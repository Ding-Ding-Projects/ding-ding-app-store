# TUI GitHub workflows

## Prerequisite and authentication

GitHub features use the installed `gh` executable. Authenticate outside the app
with the GitHub CLI's normal device/browser flow:

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

Do not paste a token into a TUI text box, repository setting, command argument,
or support log. The TUI asks `gh` for status and required scopes; `gh` and its
credential store own the secret. Local Git workflows remain available if `gh` is
missing, signed out, or lacks a scope.

The provider adapter sets `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1`, disables the update notifier
and pagers, requests no color, runs `gh` without a shell, supplies stdin only
for an explicit request body, and applies a default 30-second/maximum 120-second
timeout.

## Repository binding

The GitHub pane derives the provider repository from the active Git remote.
Provider calls are scoped to that owner/name and host. If no unambiguous GitHub
remote can be derived, the pane reports the problem instead of guessing another
repository.

## Issues

The Issues tab can list and inspect issues, create one from title/body inputs,
comment, and close a selected issue. The service boundary has additional
metadata/state operations that are not all exposed in the terminal pane. The UI
is a useful core, not full desktop triage parity: saved views, bulk planning,
project mutation, and every timeline event are not claimed.

## Pull requests

The Pull Requests tab can list and inspect requests, create one from base/head,
title, and body inputs, submit explicit review states, and merge after
confirmation. Its nested Review surface loads paginated files with a 120 KiB
per-patch bound, combines exact-head check runs with legacy commit statuses,
lists review activity, and creates a comment only against an exact commit SHA,
path, line, and side. The Effective rules surface inspects active rules for one
exact branch without pretending to administer them.

Template discovery, draft/maintainer settings, exact-account selection,
multi-line suggestion editing, offline review, fork checkout, and complete
rule administration remain partial or unavailable and are labelled in the
surface rather than hidden.

## Actions

The Actions tab supports paginated workflow/run browsing with workflow, branch,
event, and status filters; jobs, steps, run logs, and bounded job-log inspection;
JSON-scalar dispatch inputs; full and failed-only reruns; and
confirmation-gated cancellation. Independent Caches and Artifacts surfaces use
their own regex-capable searches. Cache deletion requires a reviewed numeric
ID. Artifact download rejects expired or oversized records, uses bounded binary
transport and an atomic destination, and requires a matching SHA-256 digest.

Cache archive download, arbitrary dispatch field widgets, deployment approval,
and a local Actions runner are not claimed.

## Releases, packages, and projects

The Releases surface lists releases and assets and provides reviewed
create/update/publish/delete operations plus bounded, atomic asset download.
The Packages surface exposes versions and metadata. Multipart release upload,
package content transfer, and update-feed behavior are not claimed. The
dedicated [Cheap LFS manager](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.09c0b0de12d76ba9) is a
narrow exception: after an explicit plan and confirmation it may create or add
verified immutable assets to an app-managed storage prerelease. It cannot edit
an ordinary Release. Projects inventory is also read-only and requires the
token scopes that GitHub enforces; a missing `read:project` scope is reported
rather than silently returning an empty workspace.

### Super Express Linux TUI lane

The manual `.github/workflows/super-express-release.yml` dispatcher calls
`.github/workflows/super-express-release-linux-tui.yml` on the registered
`[self-hosted, Linux, X64]` WSL runner in parallel with the Windows x64 lane.
The coordinator and publisher use that same Linux runner; no Super Express job
uses a GitHub-hosted cloud runner. This is an emergency zero-test path: it does
not run the TUI suite, parity generation, Ruff, mypy, installer smoke, or the
Debian acceptance container. It does run the packaging-only checks needed to
avoid a misleading payload: the exact commit is checked out, managed Python
3.12 is installed through `uv python install 3.12`, `uv build` creates one
wheel and one source distribution, `uv export --locked` creates the matching
runtime constraints, and both checked-in shell installers pass `sh -n` and are
copied as executable release assets.

The Linux TUI lane also has its own `workflow_dispatch` trigger. Dispatching
it from `main` with an optional exact commit SHA runs the same packaging-only
lane and uploads a verified TUI artifact without publishing a Release. Use the
combined `.github/workflows/super-express-release.yml` dispatcher when the
Windows and Linux payloads must be published together.

The dispatcher downloads the verified Windows and TUI artifacts and publishes
one combined immutable Release. The TUI wheel, source distribution, runtime
constraints, `install-linux-tui.sh`, and `bootstrap-linux-tui.sh` therefore
remain beside the Windows `RELEASES` feed, portable ZIP, installer, and NuGet
package under the same `latest` redirect. A failed lane prevents publication
but retains its artifact for recovery; clearing the dispatch `publish` input
also retains both lane artifacts without creating a Release.

## Repository notifications

The Notifications surface lists the active repository's inbox with an
independent regex-capable search, selected-thread detail, and an explicit
mark-selected-read action. It does not silently mark every notification read or
claim a cross-provider global inbox.

## Bounded API explorer

The API tab exposes method/path/body text inputs and a scrollable response. REST
paths and GraphQL documents pass through length, method, timeout, response, and
repository/host validation in the service. It is intended for deliberate
repository-scoped inspection, not arbitrary shell execution.

The TUI does not expose its own HTTP server, so a TUI-specific Postman
collection is not applicable. The repository's existing Postman collections
document the separate opt-in Agent API; the terminal explorer talks to GitHub's
API through `gh`.

An API call can mutate remote state when the chosen method and endpoint do so.
Review the method, exact path, active repository, and body. Decision
confirmations in purpose-built issue/PR/Actions flows do not automatically make
an arbitrary explorer request safe.

## Failure modes

- not signed in: run `gh auth login` in a trusted shell;
- missing scope: refresh the account through `gh auth refresh` after reviewing
  the requested scope;
- rate limit or server error: the pane keeps the failure visible for retry;
- timeout: narrow the request or retry after confirming network health;
- repository moved/renamed: repair the Git remote and rebind the pane;
- malformed/oversized response: the bounded client rejects it rather than
  filling memory or rendering untrusted terminal control data.
