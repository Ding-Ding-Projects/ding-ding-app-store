The generated mark above is documentation artwork. It is not embedded in the
pointer format and is not required by the transfer protocol.

During restore, detailed download progress can be collapsed while the
repository, provider, phase, and cancel action remain visible. The toggle is
keyboard and screen-reader operable, and the command palette can expand or
collapse the same live surface directly.

The inspected acceptance frame above comes from the production bundle running
on an off-screen Win32 desktop. The same dated exercise materialized and
re-pinned deterministic 1 MiB payloads through the Large files UI in retained
public and private GitHub repositories; see the
[public/private UI receipt](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.b6a99770849bdddb).

The repository rail's **Large files** manager can pin a working-tree file to
one or more GitHub Release assets and leave a small, human-readable pointer at
its tracked path. It is intentionally not Git LFS: a client without Desktop
Material sees the pointer text, and collaborators need access to the referenced
release to materialize the original bytes. The manager lists and searches
committed pointers, restores one or all files, and removes the need to browse or
decode the backing Release asset names. The same panel remains available from
Repository Tools for users who enter through the tools hub. The repository-rail
page owns its vertical scroll, keeping every row reachable in a long inventory.
Choose **Open Cheap LFS settings** in that page to open **Repository settings →
Cheap LFS** directly.

The original bytes are in the named GitHub Release asset or ordered assets, not
inside the Git commit. A fresh clone therefore receives the pointer first.
Desktop Material's default-on clone/open detector then downloads, verifies, and
atomically restores the working-tree file. An older pointer-only clone can be
refreshed by reopening it in the updated app or choosing **Materialize all** in
**Large files**. The committed Git blob remains the pointer so another clone can
repeat the same verified restore. Explicitly public GitHub.com Release pointers
can take this path while signed out; private and unknown repositories remain
account-gated.

New Release uploads can also use optional password encryption. The setting is
off by default, asks for a masked repository-scoped password plus an
irreversible-loss acknowledgement, and never writes the password to settings or
Git. Existing plaintext pointers remain readable; encrypted pointers verify
both ciphertext and plaintext receipts before restoring. See
[Cheap LFS Release payload encryption](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.16ccb5285b3f6b64)
for the container, credential-vault, failure, and verification contracts.

### Historical Linux terminal interoperability

The archived Linux TUI prototype read and wrote this same v1 Release pointer
format during its July 27 exercise. Its clickable **Cheap LFS** tab,
`dmt cheap-lfs` commands, 500 MiB new-write bound, 2 GiB legacy-read boundary,
and parity gaps are historical prototype facts, not current supported-product
commitments. See the
[archived Cheap LFS TUI record](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.09c0b0de12d76ba9) for its exact dated
behavior and safety contract.

## Behavior and configuration

### Bounded working-tree pointer inventory

Working-tree pointer discovery never sends file content to
`git grep --untracked`. For an unscoped refresh, Git returns only the
NUL-delimited names of changed and untracked files. A user-selected path list
is normalized and rejected if unsafe before any inventory subprocess starts.

That unscoped list belongs to ordinary Git status, not to a user-requested
Cheap LFS operation. Ineligible metadata such as `.gitmodules`,
`.github/workflows/...`, and gitlink directories is therefore skipped before
filesystem access instead of being mislabeled as an “unsafe Cheap LFS tracked
path.” The stricter boundary still applies to an explicit Cheap LFS pathspec:
selecting `.gitmodules` directly is rejected, so the false-positive correction
does not expand what Cheap LFS may read.

Commit enforcement still measures safe repository-relative dot paths before it
decides whether they are pinnable. If a protected path such as
`.github/oversized.bin` exceeds the receive threshold, Desktop reports an
explicit per-file failure and excludes its raw bytes from the commit before any
provider probe, password prompt, release anchor, upload, commit, or push can
run. Small `.gitmodules` edits remain ordinary Git content and are never sent
through Cheap LFS pointer inventory.

Desktop Material then resolves each name below the canonical repository root,
refuses owned scratch paths, directories and gitlinks, symlinks/reparse points,
and multiply linked files, and reads at most the first **512 bytes** through an
identity-proven tracked-path handle. The handle, visible pathname, and every
parent directory are revalidated before that prefix can be used. An unsettled
timestamp proof, concurrent replacement, link change, invalid bound, or path
redirect fails closed.

That prefix decides only whether a file is a pointer candidate. A
pointer-looking file still goes through the existing whole-pointer byte limit
and parser; an oversized pointer-shaped file is rejected rather than partially
inventoried. An ordinary raw payload, including a multi-gigabyte model file,
never reaches a content-scanning Git process. Committed index/HEAD pointer
metadata uses the separate Git-object inventory path and does not weaken this
working-tree bound.

The regression fixture creates an ordinary untracked `.gitmodules` file plus a
`.github/workflows/build.yml`, proves an unscoped pointer inventory returns no
objects and no error, then proves an explicit `.gitmodules` Cheap LFS request
still fails closed. The off-screen submodule scene also checks the real
notification stack for the absence of the former false-positive error.

**Repository settings → Cheap LFS → Large-file storage** selects a
published GitHub prerelease, one GHCR OCI image, or one Docker Hub OCI image.
The Cheap LFS preferences live on their own tab in the Repository Settings
dialog, immediately after **Build & run**, and the Large files page's direct
settings action opens that tab; users do not need to leave the repository and
hunt through global preferences.
In the repository **Releases** catalog, Desktop Material hides recognized Cheap
LFS storage-bucket prereleases by default so app-managed object storage does not
crowd ordinary product releases. Choose **Show Cheap LFS storage releases** to
reveal them in the same loaded catalog; turning the option off hides them again
without deleting, publishing, or otherwise changing any release or asset.
The commit panel recommends ordinary Git, Releases, GHCR, or Docker Hub from the
selected byte total and detected local provider setup, but does not silently
change the saved choice. A configured account or credential does not prove live
quota, billing, organization policy, or service health. This page describes
Release storage; see the
[Cheap LFS OCI registry backend](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.62007f3b1976de91) for image
snapshots, add/remove behavior, timeout splitting, and private encryption.

### Provider-first push boundary and comparison guide

On an already-published branch whose remote tip still matches the reviewed
parent, Cheap LFS completes the provider upload checks and source revalidation
**before** it creates the pointer commit. The following ordinary `git push`
therefore publishes that pointer commit; it is not a Git LFS-style pre-push
upload, and running `git push` alone does not pin an unprepared working-tree
file.

Release-backed storage has one first-branch exception because a Release needs a
commit already published on GitHub. For an unpublished branch, Desktop Material
first publishes and re-reads the exact existing tip—or creates one empty
bootstrap commit for an unborn repository—then reviews the now-visible Release
inventory and starts the provider upload. That create-only anchor is a separate
publication step, not proof that the later pointer commit reached the remote.

The bilingual [Cheap LFS Pages product
guide](https://ding-ding-projects.github.io/desktop-material/cheap-lfs.html)
includes the complete provider-first [push
walkthrough](https://ding-ding-projects.github.io/desktop-material/cheap-lfs.html#push).
The separate [Cheap LFS versus Git LFS comparison
atlas](https://ding-ding-projects.github.io/desktop-material/cheap-lfs-vs-git-lfs.html)
expands the choice into 72 row-level sourced criteria across 12 categories,
with an exact publication proof, workflow graphics, composable filters, and
honest Cheap/Git/tie/depends signals. It distinguishes Desktop Material
behavior from the Git LFS standard and from GitHub-specific billing,
collaboration, limits, Releases, archives, and Pages policy.

A manual pin reviews the source file, repository-relative pointer path,
release tag, optional release name, and byte size. The default tag is `assets`;
if it has no release, the app creates a published prerelease so collaborators
can fetch its assets while the bucket remains outside the installer's stable
`/releases/latest` update feed. A draft created by an older Desktop Material is
published in place only after its exact reviewed identity and Cheap LFS
provenance are revalidated. Current buckets carry the exact
`<!-- desktop-material:cheap-lfs-release-bucket:v1 -->` body sentinel; a legacy
prerelease remains writable when at least one asset carries a valid
`cheap-lfs/v1` provenance label. A stable release or unrelated prerelease that
happens to use the requested tag is never published or appended to; choose a
different tag. Existing pointers can still restore from an explicitly named
historical Release without claiming it as app-managed storage.
A file at or below the per-asset cap initially uploads as one raw asset. A
larger file is split into ordered raw parts of at most 500 MiB. GitHub
historically allowed legacy Release pointers with parts up to 2 GiB, and the
reader retains that compatibility, but uploads near that ceiling proved
unreliable, so new writes use the smaller retryable part size. The pointer
records every part's name, size, and SHA-256 as well as the whole-file size and
digest. The raw upload is immediately cloneable and remains the safe fallback
while optional cloud compression runs.

### Cloud compression

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Historical July 22 private-caller cloud-compression acceptance at immutable source commit f7b4760a13894f0320f7b361f055f6fba40d913f.*

That immutable frame proves the July 22 caller behavior only. It remains
historical evidence; the repository-local route and publication rules below
define current behavior.

Cloud compression is automatic for a repository whose GitHub visibility is
confirmed public. It is off by default for private repositories and runs there
only after the user explicitly enables the persisted **Cloud compression**
setting; unknown visibility fails closed.

The managed caller always runs in the repository that owns the Release objects:

| Policy | Route | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `automatic-public` | `in-repo-workflow` | One owned caller at `.github/workflows/cheap-lfs-cloud-compression.yml` is handed to the default-branch background publisher. |
| `enabled-private` | `in-repo-workflow` | The same owned caller is rendered with its private arm enabled and handed to the default-branch background publisher. Each run uses that private repository's GitHub Actions minutes. |
| `disabled-private` | `none`, except managed shutdown | No caller is created. If any app-owned noncanonical caller is committed or present in the working tree (including an older armed template), its guard is closed with the current canonical file and any resulting one-file transition enters the default-branch background publisher. |
| `not-github` | `none` | Nothing. |
| `visibility-unknown` | `blocked-visibility-unknown` | Neither route runs. The blocker is reported as a non-blocking notice. |

Opening the Large files manager queues a read-only policy reconciliation for
either active policy. The caller is written only after the worker owns the
shared checkout gate. When committed history does not already carry the exact
caller, the app commits and pushes it in the background — see
[Background workflow install](#background-workflow-install). A private opt-out
uses the same publisher only when an existing owned caller must be closed.

#### Private repositories: explicit in-repository publishing

Private compression is a deliberate cost choice. The setting says plainly that
each run uses the private repository's GitHub Actions minutes. When the user
enables it, `renderCheapLfsCloudCompressionWorkflow(true)` emits:

```yaml
# Private repository opt-in: enabled
...
if: >-
  github.ref_type == 'branch' && github.ref == format('refs/heads/{0}',
  github.event.repository.default_branch) &&
  (github.event.repository.private == false || true)
```

The exact managed file then enters the background publication flow on the
repository's checked-out default branch. This includes the important transition
where a prior managed caller exists with `|| false`: the explicit opt-in is
recognized as a reviewed guard transition rather than being mistaken for an
unrelated workflow edit. Only the remote-tip proof described below reports it
as ready; a diverged default branch remains pending for the user's own push.

The caller does not carry a cross-repository destination or a stored personal
token. Its composite action receives the calling run's `github.token`;
`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is the Release and API target; and `origin` is the only Git
push target. `permissions: contents: write` grants the job only the calling
repository access it needs to read and update its managed prerelease assets and
publish the verified pointer commit. Checkout and compressor actions stay
pinned by full commit SHA.

The workflow also checks the live event visibility and exact default-branch ref
on every run. A public caller whose repository becomes private therefore stops
unless its managed guard was explicitly armed. Turning private compression off
never creates a caller merely to record the setting. If an app-owned committed
caller or working copy is noncanonical, however — an armed current caller or an
older armed template — the app renders its current canonical `|| false` guard,
commits any resulting one-file shutdown, and publishes it from the checked-out
default branch. The
opt-out is not treated as remotely complete until the remote tip proves that
shutdown landed. An unowned file at the same path is never overwritten.

Moving a private repository from Release storage to GHCR or Docker Hub applies
that same closed guard to any existing owned caller. A public closed guard would
still run on a public repository, so a public provider transition instead
removes the owned Release caller and publishes that one-path deletion. An absent
caller remains absent, and an unowned caller remains protected.

Unknown visibility remains a hard stop. The app neither creates nor arms a
caller until GitHub reports the repository as exactly public or private, so it
cannot accidentally spend private Actions minutes before consent.

#### Background workflow install

GitHub Actions only sees committed files, so a checkout holding the caller as an
uncommitted change is still a checkout where nothing compresses. Leaving that
last step to the user is the step that silently never happened. Enabling cloud
compression, opening the Large files manager, and the post-materialize repair
therefore each ask the background installer to close the gap. Each request
carries the freshly persisted preferences that triggered it. It records a
monotonic per-repository generation synchronously, before any read, so rapid
enable/disable or provider transitions cannot be evaluated out of call order.
The worker drains the latest generation before releasing its mutation gate.

Detection reads the committed blob at the exact path
`.github/workflows/cheap-lfs-cloud-compression.yml`, never the working tree
alone, and produces one outcome:

| Observation | Outcome | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compression off, or a non-Release storage provider, with no managed caller to close or remove | `disabled` | Nothing. |
| Confirmed private repository with the explicit opt-in | Active in-repository route | Install or arm the canonical caller, then publish it from the default branch. |
| Confirmed private repository opted out, or left Release storage, with any committed or working app-owned noncanonical caller | Managed shutdown | Render the current canonical closed guard, then publish any one-file transition from the default branch. |
| Confirmed public repository left Release storage with an owned caller | Managed removal | Remove the Release caller, commit that exact deletion, and publish it from the default branch. |
| Visibility not confirmed by GitHub | `blocked-visibility-unknown` | Neither route runs; reported once. |
| Active route with no committed caller, and a working tree that is empty or already canonical | `install` | Write the canonical caller and hand it to the default-branch commit/publish flow. |
| Committed caller is byte-identical to canonical | `installed` | Nothing, including when the user has edited their working copy. |
| An active-policy caller exists but differs from the canonical or reviewed guard transition | `offer-update` | A non-blocking notice offers a confirm-class one-click update. Never replaced silently. |
| Anything without the managed marker occupies the path | `blocked-unowned` | Left completely untouched; reported once. |

Unknown visibility stops before any mutation. Confirmed private opt-in uses the
same owned in-repository route as public compression. Confirmed private opt-out
may reach the writer only to turn a committed app-owned noncanonical caller into
the current closed guard; it never installs a new caller. Content the app does
not own remains protected in every policy.

The same route gates the commit path. When an automatic large-file pin runs,
`_commitIncludedChanges` includes an uncommitted managed caller in that commit
only when `cheapLfsCloudCompressionUsesInRepoWorkflow` is true. A private
opt-out is instead handled as the background publisher's explicit one-file
shutdown; it is not smuggled into an unrelated user commit.

The request remains non-blocking to the UI, but every authoritative inspection,
write, commit, and push waits for the repository's shared commit/materialize
ownership. A clone restore, materialization, or another accepted commit finishes
first; once workflow publication owns the gate, a later restore waits.
Post-materialize repair is queued only after that restore releases. The
latest-wins reconcile scheduler replaces an older queued generation instead of
dropping the newer setting. If a generation changes during a write, the worker
compare-and-swap restores the prior app-owned working bytes and index state only
while the scheduler-produced file receipt and observed index preimage still
match. A newer file edit or same-path stage wins and is preserved; rollback
never writes over an unowned replacement.
Confirm-class consent to replace a divergent managed caller belongs only to the
exact confirmed generation and is never inherited by an ordinary reconcile.
Progress and failures stay in the notification centre and non-blocking notice
stack.

Only the workflow path is committed. A temporary index is seeded from the
observed parent, stages only that path, writes one tree, and creates the commit
with `git commit-tree`; an exact `update-ref` then advances only the still
checked-out default branch. The real index is synchronized for that one path
only, so every user-staged selection remains staged and uncommitted. The neutral
bilingual message covers installs, shutdowns, and removals:
`Reconcile Cheap LFS cloud compression policy / 對齊 Cheap LFS 雲端壓縮政策`.

Before any background commit or push, the checked-out branch must exactly match
the canonicalized repository model's provider-reported `defaultBranch`; Git's
inferred remote HEAD or `init.defaultBranch` fallback is not accepted. The exact
destination is carried as `refs/heads/<default>` through the remote probe and
push. Another branch, a detached HEAD, an ambiguous remote ref, or missing
provider default identity leaves publication pending and reports the exact
reason. The installer never checks out a different branch on the user's behalf.
Immediately before the local ref update and again before push, it proves
symbolic `HEAD`, the exact local default ref, the workflow commit's one expected
parent, and a diff containing only the workflow path.

- **Branch already published, remote tip equals the commit's parent** — the push
  goes through `ILocalCommitBatchingOperations.push` with
  `expectedRemoteSha` set to that tip, so it can only ever add this one commit,
  and the new tip is re-read from the remote with `readRemoteTip` rather than
  inferred from a successful `git push`.
- **Branch never published** — the same batching operation uses
  `expectedRemoteSha: null`, which is create-only. If the branch appears before
  push, the operation rejects; it never accepts an arbitrary newly visible tip
  as proof of the workflow commit.
- **Branch diverged from its remote** — the caller is committed locally and
  *not* pushed. A background push there would publish local commits the user
  never reviewed, so the workflow rides out with their own next push and the
  notice says so.

Only a re-read remote tip equal to the workflow commit is reported as remotely
ready. A deferred local commit remains pending until the user's own push proves
it landed.

Both the commit and the push skip hooks. This commit is app-generated,
single-file, and unattended; a `pre-commit` or `pre-push` hook waiting on a
prompt nobody is watching would hang the background task forever. The user's own
reviewed commit and push still run every hook.

Failures are reported, never retried silently, and every relayed Git string is
sanitized first. The one failure this feature provokes that nothing else does is
called out by name: GitHub refuses any push touching `.github/workflows` when
the credential lacks the `workflow` scope (or, for a GitHub App, the `workflows`
permission), and the notice says exactly that plus the fix — sign out and back
in to grant it, or push the file yourself. A moved remote branch, a missing
remote, a detached HEAD, and an unassociated checkout each get their own plain
reason.

The workflow writer canonicalizes each repository directory component, refuses
redirected parents plus symlink, junction, hardlink, oversized, and unowned
workflow entries, and writes a unique fsynced sibling before publication. New
files use exclusive publication; updates use one same-directory atomic rename
after an immediate identity/content recheck. A concurrent edit or failed rename
leaves the reviewed original intact. UI persistence and workflow setup are also
bound to the originating repository so switching repositories during a private
opt-in cannot apply that consent elsewhere.

Every tracked-path operation starts by canonicalizing the repository root, and
when that step fails the reported error names the path it failed on and the
operating system's own error code rather than stating only that
canonicalization did not happen. The distinction matters because the causes
call for different responses and are not otherwise distinguishable from the
message: `ENOENT` means the repository moved or was deleted out from under the
open window, `EACCES` or `EPERM` means the process cannot open the directory
for a final-path query (which on Windows is a handle-opening operation, so
permissions, exclusive locks, and unhydrated cloud-backed folders all surface
here), and `ELOOP` means the path redirects to itself.

Codes that mean "not right now" rather than "not safe" — `EACCES`, `EAGAIN`,
`EBUSY`, `EIO`, `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`, `EPERM`, and `UNKNOWN` — are retried up to
four times with a short growing pause. Because `realpath` has to open a handle
on Windows, it competes with on-access virus scanners, indexers, backup agents,
and Git's own working-tree writes, and under a large commit that contention is
routine and momentary; without the retry a handle held for a few milliseconds
could abort a commit of many thousands of files. `ENOENT` is excluded on
purpose: a repository that is not there is not busy, so it fails on the first
attempt instead of pausing.

Retrying is not relenting. A root that still will not canonicalize after the
last attempt fails closed, and the reparse-point, directory, and containment
checks all still run against whatever path canonicalization returns — a root
redirected by a symlink, junction, or other reparse point is refused exactly as
before. The retry changes only how long the check is willing to wait, never
what it accepts.

The caller pins both `actions/checkout` and Desktop Material's reviewed
composite compressor to immutable commit SHAs. Checkout materializes only
`.github`; the worker then refetches the exact event commit with an exclusive
512 KiB blob limit, inventories regular tree entries without lazy fetching, and
reads only locally present pointer-sized blobs. Ordinary build blobs therefore
remain promised and absent even in a multi-gigabyte repository. One
GitHub-hosted job downloads release objects directly, compresses them
sequentially with raw DEFLATE level 9, and uploads verified side assets directly
back to the Release. It does not use Actions artifacts or caches, and it removes
its temporary raw and compressed files before moving to the next object. This
one-object-at-a-time working set avoids combining multi-gigabyte parts under the
smaller Actions artifact/storage limits.

Compression is adopted only when the stored result is strictly smaller. After
the side asset's size and SHA-256 are verified, the job changes exactly one
pointer object to the existing v1
`part-deflate <original-sha256> <original-size> <stored-size> <asset-name>`
record, commits that pointer alone, and pushes it with `[skip ci]`. A multipart
pointer can therefore be mixed: successful parts become `part-deflate`, while
failed or non-beneficial parts remain ordinary `part` records. The original raw
assets are never deleted because older commits can still reference them. Pointer
adoption uses a temporary full-tree index, proves exactly one path changed,
rechecks the current remote parent, and performs an ordinary fast-forward push.
After each successful pointer commit, every queued pointer is re-proved at the
new tree before the next object begins. A verified compressed side asset is
also retained if a later compare-and-swap check loses a race; another run can
reuse it safely, while the unchanged raw pointer remains cloneable.

GitHub Actions only compresses. It never decompresses or decides that expanded
bytes are valid. Desktop Material downloads a compressed object to an owned
temporary file on the local PC, expands it with a strict output cap equal to
the recorded original size, verifies the original part SHA-256 and size, then
verifies the assembled whole-file SHA-256 and size before atomically replacing
the pointer.

GitHub permits 1,000 assets per Release. Cheap LFS inventories all ten bounded
100-item pages and keeps at most 1,000 assets in each repository Release
bucket. The configured tag names the first bucket (normally `assets`), followed
by `assets-2`, `assets-3`, and so on. A single multipart file or one complete
manual batch is allocated atomically: when it would cross the remaining slots,
the entire group moves to the next bucket and every generated pointer records
that exact derived tag.

Current buckets are published prereleases and resolve through GitHub's direct
release-by-tag endpoint. For compatibility, bounded lookup can still identify
an older draft among at most 100 pages of 100 releases. Desktop Material
publishes that exact legacy bucket in place before a new pin only when the
exact sentinel or a valid legacy asset-provenance label proves it is Cheap LFS
storage. Materialization may read a pointer's unrecognized draft asset but does
not publish that draft. The cloud Action mutates only a published, managed
prerelease: a draft, stable Release, or unrelated prerelease is rejected before
download or upload, leaving the raw pointer unchanged. Compression also needs
one free asset slot for its verified side object. If the selected Release has
already reached its
**1,000-asset** capacity, the upload cannot be adopted and the raw pointer
remains cloneable and locally materializable. Cheap LFS never deletes the
historical raw asset merely to make room.

The repository's **Cheap LFS** settings tab provides three preferences, all
enabled by default for compatibility:

- **Pin large files before committing** replaces selected files strictly over
  100 MiB before every routed commit entry point when the source repository's
  identity/visibility and the chosen backend credentials are available. The
  selector first stats every reviewed path, skips ordinary and exact-threshold
  files without hashing or tracked-content proof, then requires the same exact
  repository/path-bound destination proof for every oversized candidate. This
  keeps very large selections responsive without weakening large-file source
  validation.
- **Upload up to three large files at once** assigns automatic pins to three
  deterministic Release lanes. Turning it off restores one-at-a-time uploads.
- **Download large files after cloning** materializes detected pointers after
  clone, pull, user fetch, or open under one cancelable per-repository batch.
  The panel also offers explicit per-file and Materialize all actions.
  Canceling Materialize all cancels repository-wide: every batch still queued
  behind the active one (including automatic restores enqueued by a concurrent
  fetch or pull) aborts too, so a canceled download cannot restart when the
  next batch takes over the queue slot. A single-file cancel stays scoped to
  its own request. The batch resolves with a summary, and the panel reports
  partial failure ("Materialized N files; M files failed and were left as
  pointers.") instead of claiming unconditional success, then reloads the
  pinned-file list after completion **and** after a cancel so completed files
  never keep a stale pointer state (which previously also suppressed the
  local-deletion warning on Remove).

### Exact-90% restore look-ahead and detailed progress

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Detailed Cheap LFS restore progress with the current transfer at exactly 90% and the next transfer already active.*

Release-backed restore now uses one shared, batch-local download coordinator
with a hard maximum of **two active HTTP downloads**. The current file or part
keeps its first lane. As soon as the provider reports
`transferred / total >= 90%`, the next file or multipart part may enter the
second look-ahead lane. A report at 899/1000 does not open it; 900/1000 does.
The threshold is fixed rather than user-configurable, so every clone/open,
fetch/pull, single-file, and Materialize-all path gets the same bound.

Multipart restore applies the same rule inside one pointer: resolve every
required asset first, start part 1, and begin part 2 at part 1's exact 90%
network point. The shared coordinator still caps the entire nested operation
at two downloads, so file-level and part-level look-ahead cannot multiply into
unbounded traffic. If a provider supplies no usable progress total, settlement
of the current transfer is the conservative fallback that opens the next lane.

Look-ahead is only a download scheduling optimization. Every part is still
decompressed when required, checked against its own recorded size and SHA-256,
assembled in pointer order, checked against the whole-file size and SHA-256,
and atomically published only while the tracked pointer is unchanged. A failed
prefetch is drained and its owned temporary data is cleaned; a failure stays
attached to its input path and remaining pointers continue. Cancellation stops
new work, aborts queued or active downloads, drains the two lanes, and leaves
unverified pointers untouched.

The shared restore panel is used by the Large files surface and clone/batch
restore progress. It exposes substantially more than one aggregate percentage:

- repository, provider, phase, current path, file ordinal, and multipart
  ordinal;
- succeeded, failed, remaining, total, queued-file, and queued-part counts;
- logical restored bytes and, when the provider supplies them, actual
  downloaded/compressed bytes;
- overall progress plus separate **Current** and **Next at 90%** lane bars;
- downloading, decrypting, decompressing, verifying, materializing, and
  canceling states;
- elapsed time, observed download rate, ETA, and the fixed 90% handoff point;
  and
- bounded per-file failure details plus an honest cancellation state.

Visible counters and bars may update continuously, while the screen-reader live
summary is bucketed to meaningful 10% transitions so frequent transfer events
do not flood announcements. Reduced-motion mode removes the active shimmer,
and narrow/bilingual layouts wrap rather than clipping at high Windows scale.
Legacy sequential progress is adapted into this richer model, keeping older
callers truthful while they adopt lane detail.

An encrypted-and-compressed Release restore reports the production transform
order exactly: **Downloading → Decrypting → Decompressing → Verifying →
Materializing**. Decryption has its own phase because authenticated decryption

The Changes filter includes a **Large files** chip that matches working-tree
files strictly over the same 100 MiB Cheap LFS threshold. Its bounded,
generation-fenced size scan combines with text, regex, included/excluded, and
status filters instead of replacing them. Deleted or missing paths do not
match, and an unreadable or unknown size fails closed rather than being shown
as a safely classified large-file candidate.

The same settings surface shows public cloud compression as automatic and
read-only. A private repository receives a separate off-by-default checkbox
that states plainly, before recording consent, that enabling it publishes the
managed workflow in that repository and uses the user's private Actions
minutes. Opting in reports the real workflow-added or workflow-ready state;
turning it off closes the managed private guard.
English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual modes cover the
setting, manager status, local-only decompression notice, raw/compressed/mixed
pointer badges, and every background workflow-install and visibility-blocked
notice.

### Post-commit payload restore

A pin uploads from a private copy in the OS temp directory, replaces the
working-tree original with pointer text, and deletes both. Before this contract
existed, a repository that had just committed large files therefore held no
copy of them at all: the post-commit inventory classified every freshly pinned
path as `pointer`, and the very next auto-materialize detect point — a
user-initiated fetch, any pull (including the pull that "Commit & push all"
performs first), reopening or re-selecting the repository, or re-registering it
— downloaded bytes that had been on the machine seconds earlier. Which detect
point fired first is why the same commit sometimes re-downloaded everything and
sometimes did not (#55).

The commit flow now keeps the verified copy alive across the commit and puts it
back:

- `pinFileToRelease` accepts `retainSourceForRestore`. With it set, the private
  upload copy is **not** deleted on the success path, and the pin result carries
  the owned handle plus the payload's proven size and SHA-256. Every failure,
  abort, and early throw still deletes it exactly as before.
- The retained handles travel with the automatic-pin outcome. Whatever is not
  handed back to the commit — an aborted lane, a failed batch, an automatic
  batch superseded by the manual browser handoff — is discarded in the pin
  run's own `finally`, and the commit discards what it received in a `finally`
  of its own. No exit path leaks a temp payload.
- After every commit batch succeeds, and before the Changes refresh, each
  retained payload is reinstalled over the pointer that commit just recorded.
- Restoring turns the entry from `pointer` into `materialized`, and
  `materialized` is excluded from the set the auto-materialize detectors select.
  The result is zero downloads for a file this machine just uploaded.

Verification is not weakened anywhere. A path is touched only when the bytes
currently on disk are byte-for-byte the pointer text that pin published — a
concurrent edit, a checkout, or a failed commit leaves the path strictly alone.
The reinstall goes through the same `replaceFromPath` the download path uses, so
the retained copy is re-hashed and rejected on any size or SHA-256 drift exactly
as a corrupted download is. Nothing here throws: on any failure the committed
pointer is left intact and that file simply materializes later, which is the
behavior that existed before this contract. `cleanupOwned` remains
identity-checked, so a temp replaced by something else is preserved and logged
rather than deleted.

### Never re-pinning an unchanged payload

A selected file whose working-tree bytes are *proven* identical to the pointer
`HEAD` already holds is neither re-uploaded nor committed. Re-pinning it would
spend the user's bandwidth on a byte-identical asset, and committing it would
stage raw bytes into a commit that already contains that exact pointer.

The proof required is deliberately strict, because the consequence is leaving a
path out of the user's commit. All of the following must hold: the inventory
scan recorded an explicit working-tree content hash, that hash equals the
pointer's own digest, the sizes match exactly, and the entry classified as
`materialized` — which is what proves the index pointer is the committed one
rather than a staged rewrite. The classification alone is never sufficient:
identity-only scans legitimately leave the working-tree hash undefined, and a
size-mismatched `modified` entry has no hash at all. Anything the scan cannot
prove is pinned and committed exactly as before, so a genuinely edited large
file is never silently dropped from a commit.

Files left out this way are reported in a notification naming them and stating
that nothing was uploaded because the commit already holds their pointers, in
English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual modes.

### Private pointer commit-key guard

A private OCI pointer binds its exact shared registry key to the commit. The
commit preflight therefore keeps unsafe selected paths fail-closed and never
treats an unreadable path as proof of a key. There is one narrow compatibility
exception for deleting a legacy path that Windows cannot safely address: the
app must freshly read repository-bound Git status and prove that the exact
normalized selected path is currently deleted. Because no working-tree content
is being admitted, that status-proven deletion can proceed without reopening
the hostile name.

The exception does not apply to an added, modified, renamed, untracked, missing,
or otherwise nondeleted unsafe path, nor when live status is absent or disagrees
with the selection. A safely readable control-plane path that contains a real
OCI pointer also remains rejected. Ordinary manifests and workflows in such a
control-plane directory may commit, but they cannot be used to smuggle a private
pointer around its exact key proof.

Automatic pinning reports separate hashing, release preparation, upload, and
verification phases. With parallel upload enabled it runs at most three stable
lanes (`assets`, `assets-parallel-2`, and `assets-parallel-3`), while each lane
still mutates its reviewed Release sequentially. The commit composer keeps a
compact terminal-style panel directly below Commit with up to three sanitized
active-file rows, per-file phase and bytes, worker/queue/provider context,
elapsed time, renderer-observed throughput and ETA, aggregate transferred
bytes, and success/failure counts. Long storage recommendations use a native,
keyboard-focusable disclosure. It never renders raw provider or process output.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Historical English Cheap LFS commit-progress acceptance at immutable source commit c3db37ea5524b91f9603151ae5d1107205f16a59.*

The historical initial-`c3db37ea55` UI gate rebuilt the production bundle in
400.46 seconds and exercised this Cheap LFS surface on an isolated off-screen
Win32 desktop without diagnostic style injection. The promoted 1,440 x 960 wide
capture has SHA-256
`3d6358567126e3ce0504b04c4489abbfd473b77546bd82dac834553d50fe9333`.
A separate 640 x 960 bilingual narrow capture kept all three worker rows and
both actions contained; its SHA-256 is
`1b99c827d1b5b2cf05298fb1255873acdf0502f72a40437c378c0be7bb989e50`.

After the workers settle, Desktop Material reloads status and stages successful
pointers rather than original binaries. A failed raw file is excluded from the
current commit and remains in Changes for retry; unrelated selected changes and
successful pointers can commit. If nothing safe remains, no empty commit is
created. A partially selected oversized file fails closed before upload because
replacing it with a pointer would necessarily replace the whole file.
Production first uses the trusted GitHub CLI exact-length transport.
This avoids opening Electron's native upload data pipe, which can terminate the
app with a Mojo failed-precondition when the remote consumer closes during a
write. Exact source-range checks still reject files that grow or shrink after
validation, and 100% remains reserved until a valid provider response or a
reconciled asset proves acceptance.

Before a CLI upload, Desktop Material scans the selected Release's complete bounded
inventory once—up to ten 100-asset pages. If it finds one exact-name asset,
it polls only that immutable asset ID. An already completed exact-size,
exact-label, exact-digest object is reused; a persistent `starter` or other
incomplete asset remains visible as **Processing**, still consumes one of the
1,000 slots, and fails closed. The user can delete that exact incomplete asset
from Releases before retrying; it is never downloaded or treated as completed
Cheap LFS data.

When no prior object exists, Desktop Material launches only the real-path
`GitHub CLI\gh.exe` below a validated `Program Files` root and invokes a fixed
`gh api` upload. The exact validated file range is streamed to standard input,
hashed locally, and reported through bounded progress. Hashing and upload use
bounded 1 MiB disk chunks, cutting the per-part callback/write count by
roughly sixteen times versus default 64-KiB chunks without buffering the file.
The selected host and
upload URL, `GH_HOST`, and `GH_REPO` context are fixed by the account-bound
request. The token is supplied only through an isolated child environment,
never an argument; inherited GitHub CLI credentials and debug settings are
removed, an empty temporary CLI config is used, and the directory is deleted
afterward. The process has bounded output, runs without a shell, and is
terminated and awaited on cancel. Uploads run with no inactivity or
total-runtime timeout:
a slow connection can take as long as it needs, and a transfer ends only on
completion, a transport failure, or explicit user cancellation. A failed CLI
request polls briefly for a delayed completed asset. If and only if no
same-name object exists, the app performs one clean byte-zero restart; the
GitHub upload API has no resume primitive. A `starter` is never guessed to be
owned or deleted automatically. Bounded, credential-redacted CLI diagnostics
go to Log History while the visible error retains the actionable failure
reason.

GitHub may spell an absent Release-asset label as either `null` or an empty
string across upload and inventory responses. The bounded provider parser
normalizes both to one unlabeled value before exact response verification, so a
correctly uploaded, digest-matched Cheap LFS asset is not rejected solely for
that representational difference.

Cheap LFS passes the part digest from its required pointer-preparation hash to
the main process. The preferred CLI path then hashes the bytes it actually
consumes and must match that prepared digest, avoiding a redundant full-range
read before upload without trusting renderer data. Generic Release uploads and
the native compatibility path retain their independent pre-upload hash. A
prepared Cheap LFS digest is never sent through the native path because that
transport cannot prove a digest over the chunks it consumed; when the trusted
CLI is unavailable, the app directs the user to install it or use Manual
upload. Cheap LFS also retains its final whole-source verification before
replacing user bytes with a pointer, so a modification during or after transfer
cannot be silently lost.

For Release uploads that do not carry a prepared Cheap LFS digest, if that
trusted CLI cannot be resolved, the app retains a compatibility Electron
transport. It removes the fixed-length header at the final request
boundary and enables chunked encoding before writing, so it does not retain an
entire multi-gigabyte asset in process memory. Like the CLI path, it applies
no stall or runtime timeout by default; only user cancellation or a transport
failure ends the request. The manual browser handoff below is the
recommended recovery if this compatibility path cannot complete safely.

While an automatic upload is active, **Manual upload** switches the same commit
operation to a browser-assisted handoff. Desktop Material stops the current
automatic attempt, plans every remaining file, splits sources above the Release
limit into ordered `.partNNN` assets, and creates one random temporary folder
containing the exact missing asset names. A retry keeps an exact-name,
exact-size prior upload when its provider digest matches; providers without a
digest receive one bounded download-and-hash check before that asset is omitted
from staging. The app opens
the exact validated release editor and then that folder in front for drag and
drop, and waits for the user to upload and save all files to the selected
`assets` bucket. Older GitHub Enterprise responses without a usable release web URL
fall back to the validated repository Releases listing. Whole-file assets use
verified same-volume hardlinks, then bounded streamed copies if a hardlink is
unavailable. The browser folder never contains symlinks: every staged path is
re-read with `lstat`, `stat`, and its expected nonzero size before Explorer can
open it. Multipart ranges are real files copied with one bounded 1 MiB buffer
per active range. **Cancel** stops
either phase until the verified pointer commit begins and removes only the
operation-owned handoff entries. The browser rendezvous backs polling off to a
30-second interval and remains cancelable for roughly six hours, so a slow
multi-gigabyte upload does not expire after ten minutes.

Hashing and handoff staging report byte progress across both passes, so a
multi-gigabyte source advances visibly instead of remaining at 0%. Resumed
assets begin the staging pass as completed bytes. Before any handoff starts,
the app requires enough free temporary-disk space for the worst-case copy
fallback of every missing asset, the largest still-required verification
download, and a safety reserve.
An insufficient volume fails clearly instead of filling the disk mid-copy.

GitHub Release assets have no folder hierarchy, so the handoff directory is
flat even when selected files live in nested repository folders. The manifest
maps every prepared asset back to its original repository-relative path, and
same-named files from different folders receive collision-safe hash suffixes.
Reservation uses Windows' case-insensitive comparison, so `Foo.bin` and
`foo.bin` cannot collide in the flat folder.
The app waits for every new or safely reused part, verifies each required
download and then the whole source, and writes each pointer at its exact
original path. A timeout or cancellation leaves a valid uploaded subset on the
Release so the next manual attempt can stage only the missing names.

## Persistence

The committed pointer contains a format version, release tag, base asset name,
whole-file byte size and SHA-256, plus ordered raw or `part-deflate` records when
required. The binary bytes remain in published GitHub prerelease assets so a
fresh public clone can restore them while signed out, and a private clone can
restore them with its selected authorized account, without an owner-only draft
step.
Per-repository auto-pin,
three-wide-versus-sequential upload mode, auto-materialize, and private
cloud-compression consent are stored in the repository's shared Build & Run
preference record and edited on the dedicated **Cheap LFS** settings tab.
Preferences written by an older app have no parallel-upload field
and resolve compatibly to the new default-on mode.

Materialization writes verified bytes into a private sibling recovery
directory. It revalidates the canonical repository root, every parent in the
tracked path, and the exact pointer identity and contents before quarantining
that pointer. The replacement is published with an exclusive hard link, so a
concurrently created destination is never overwritten. Original and staged
names are removed only after the published identity, size, and digest are
proved; an uncertain race preserves the recovery directory and reports its
path. Multipart files still verify every part and calculate the whole digest
before this compare-and-exchange begins.
One Materialize-all run caches release metadata by tag. When the bounded
release preview does not already contain every required uploaded name, it also
caches one complete paginated asset inventory by release ID. Pointers in the
same `assets` bucket therefore do not issue thousands of duplicate inventory
requests.
Automatic clone/open materialization and explicit Materialize-all work share a
repository-scoped scheduler. This keeps two UI entry points from concurrently
publishing the same restored path through separate compare-and-swap recovery
flows. Within one active Release batch, the nested file/part download
coordinator is separately capped at two lanes and opens its look-ahead lane only
at the fixed 90% transfer boundary described above.

### When a path identity may replace a content re-hash

An upload of a multi-gigabyte payload cannot afford to read the file once per
safety check, so `prepareUpload` captures the destination and the source by
**identity only** — device, inode, birth time, change time, modification time,
size, link count, and mode — and lets the single streamed owned copy be the
operation's one authoritative content hash. Every later boundary revalidates
that identity instead of re-reading the payload.

That substitution is only sound while an identity match really does imply the
bytes are unchanged, and by itself it does not. `mtime` is *reported* in
nanoseconds but only moves once the clock the kernel stamps writes from has
ticked, so two different writes inside one tick share a modification time, share
a change time, and — for a same-size rewrite — share a size. An identity
captured inside its own modification tick therefore proves nothing at all about
content. This is the hazard Git calls **racily clean**, and Cheap LFS answers it
the way Git does: distrust the stat cache and re-read.

Concretely, an identity is **settled** only when its modification time is older
than the moment it was captured by more than the volume's timestamp granularity.
Only a settled identity may stand in for a re-hash:

- **Settled and matching** — the identity is trusted and no content is read.
  This is the ordinary case and it costs nothing extra.
- **Racy, and the proof carries a full content hash** — the file is re-hashed
  and the digest, size, and inode must all match. Deferred-hash proofs from
  `prepareUpload` deliberately carry no hash.
- **Racy with no content proof** — the operation fails closed exactly as an
  identity mismatch always did, preserving the recovery directory and reporting
  its path. No unproven bytes are ever published.

Granularity is never assumed to be a universal constant. A file whose
modification time is already more than **two seconds** older than the capture is
settled immediately with no probe, no wait, and no extra read — two seconds is
the coarsest granularity Desktop Material expects to meet, since FAT/exFAT-class
volumes and several network filesystems quantize that far. Only a file modified
inside that window consults the volume's real granularity, which is measured
once per device by rewriting a private probe file and taking the smallest
observable step between two modification times. Every observed step is a whole
multiple of the true quantum, so the measurement can only over-estimate, which
is the safe direction; a probed value is additionally floored at 16 ms because
Windows stamps writes from a system clock whose default tick is 15.625 ms and
which any process may raise or lower at runtime. A volume too coarse to show a
step, a read-only tree, a denied write, or any other probe failure simply keeps
the two-second bound — the probe never fails the operation it runs inside.

A file that was written moments ago is settled by waiting out the remainder of
its own modification tick and reading the identity again, so that the capture
becomes provably older than one tick. Identities are settled *before* content is
hashed, which also means the hash a proof carries is bracketed by a modification
time any concurrent write is now bound to move. A modification time in the
future, or one so recent that the volume's granularity would demand an
unreasonable wait, is simply recorded as racy and takes the re-hash-or-fail
branches above.

The cost falls only where the risk is. A tracked file untouched for longer than
a couple of seconds — the overwhelming majority — revalidates with no wait, no
probe, and no re-hash, exactly as before. Publishing a pointer pays one
granularity tick, because the replacement it just staged has to become provable
before its identity may be trusted at the compare-and-exchange boundary.

### The streaming-hash contract: who owns each digest

A pin never re-reads a payload solely to hash it. Every digest a pin relies on
is produced by a pass that had to read those bytes anyway — the streamed copy,
the staging write, or the upload itself — and each route names exactly one
**authority** for the bytes it publishes.

| Route | Authority for the published bytes | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OCI (GHCR, Docker Hub) | **The registry.** Each object layer is pushed as `<repository>@<digest>`, where the digest came from the single streamed pass that wrote the staged layer. The OCI distribution spec requires a registry to hash what it receives and reject a mismatch, so the push succeeding *is* the destination's confirmation. | The destination already computes the digest; computing it locally a second time buys nothing it does not prove. |
| Release assets | **A streaming local hash.** GitHub returns no content digest when an asset upload completes, so the transport hashes each chunk in the same pass that writes it to the wire and reports that live digest as `localDigest`. | There is no cloud digest to defer to, so the local one must be produced during the upload rather than by a separate read. |
| Materialize (both routes) | **Unchanged.** Every restored payload is hashed on arrival and must equal the pointer's `sha256` and byte size before it may replace anything. | Downloaded bytes are untrusted input; this contract is not weakened by anything above. |

Removing a local pass does not remove a check. On the OCI route the staged
layer is still bracketed by a `lstat` identity and size check immediately
before and immediately after its own push, so a swapped or truncated staged
file fails closed locally as well; the staging write itself refuses a short or
torn write by comparing the staged length to the chunk length; and the private
upload copy's *content* is re-proved for free by the staging pass, which
refuses any source whose streamed plaintext digest differs from the object the
pointer will name. A failed blob push happens strictly before the manifest is
pushed, so a refused digest publishes nothing at all. On the release route a
transport that cannot report the bytes it actually consumed is refused outright
rather than trusted.

The measurable effect, for one payload of *N* bytes through one pin:

| Route | Full payload-sized reads before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OCI | 7 — streamed copy, pre-publish re-hash, staging read, pre-push layer re-hash, ORAS push, post-publish re-hash, per-pointer re-hash | **3** — streamed copy, staging read, ORAS push |
| Release | 2 — streamed copy, streamed upload | **2**, unchanged (already single-pass) |

The release figure is deliberately flat: that route was already reduced to one
streamed copy plus one streamed upload, and this work added regression tests
for it rather than a saving. The four passes removed are all on the OCI route.
A seam with no tracked-path store — structural test fakes and legacy adaptors —
keeps its whole-file re-reads, because there `sourcePath` is the working-tree
file itself and the re-read is its only proof.

## Optional passphrase encryption

Cheap LFS objects live in a GitHub Release — a public or semi-public place. A
repository may therefore opt in to encrypting its payloads on this machine
before they are uploaded, so the release asset holds ciphertext. It is **off by
default, per repository, and never global**.

The non-goal is recorded deliberately: **working-tree files are never encrypted
in place.** A ciphertext blob has no meaningful line diff, so it defeats Git's
diffing outright, and re-encrypting after every save draws a fresh nonce (as it
must) and therefore rewrites the whole file on every commit. That is a worse
tool than the one it would replace, so it is not built.

### The format

`app/src/lib/cheap-lfs/payload-encryption.ts` owns the container:
**AES-256-GCM** under a **scrypt** key at cost 2^17 with `r=8`, `p=1` — roughly
128 MiB per derivation — using Node's own `crypto`, with no hand-rolled
primitives anywhere. A **fresh salt and a fresh nonce are drawn on every single
call**; nonce reuse under one key does not weaken GCM, it dismantles it, so this
has its own test asserting that twelve encryptions of identical bytes produce
twelve distinct nonces and twelve distinct salts.

The container is a versioned header followed by the salt, the nonce, the tag,
and the ciphertext:

| Field | Bytes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| magic | 8 | `DMCLFS\0\x01`; a foreign file is refused, never mis-parsed |
| version | 2 | format version, currently 1 |
| cipher id / KDF id | 2 + 2 | AES-256-GCM / scrypt; anything else is refused |
| reserved | 2 | zero |
| logN, r, p | 4 + 4 + 4 | **every KDF parameter, recorded not assumed** |
| salt / nonce / tag lengths | 4 + 4 + 4 | |
| salt, nonce, tag | 16 + 12 + 16 | |
| ciphertext | remainder | exactly the plaintext length |

**Raising the cost later needs no migration.** Because `logN`, `r`, and `p` live
in each payload's own header, moving new pins from 2^17 to 2^19 leaves every
existing payload decryptable by the same build — the reader uses what the header
says, not what the current default is. Absurd, unknown, or truncated headers are
refused *before* any memory-hard derivation is spent on them, so a hostile
pointer cannot turn a restore into a memory bomb.

### What is hashed, and why both digests are recorded

This is the design decision the feature turns on. An encrypted part records
**two** digests:

| Recorded in the pointer | Taken over | Who can check it | When it is checked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| head `size` + `sha256`, and each part's `sha256` + plaintext size | the **plaintext** | the app, holding the passphrase | after decrypting, before anything replaces a file |
| each part's `stored-size` + `stored-sha256` | the **stored container** | **anyone at all, with no passphrase** | on download, before a key is derived |

The stored pair exists so that *"is the object at the provider still the object
we published?"* stays answerable by a client that cannot read the object.
Integrity must not be a privilege of whoever knows the passphrase. Recording
only the plaintext digest would make it one; recording only the ciphertext
digest would let a bug in this app's own decryption, reassembly, or ordering
publish wrong bytes over the user's file — which no authentication tag can
catch, because those bytes were authentic when they were sealed.

The plaintext pair also stays where it is for a second, unglamorous reason: the
head `size` and `sha256` are the tracked file's **identity** everywhere else in
this feature. [Never re-pinning an unchanged payload](#never-re-pinning-an-unchanged-payload)
compares a working-tree content hash to them, and
[post-commit payload restore](#post-commit-payload-restore) re-hashes its
retained copy against them. Ciphertext measurements in those fields would
silently break both.

The pointer text gains one head-adjacent line and one part record kind:

```text
version desktop-material/cheap-lfs/v1
release-tag assets
asset-name payload.bin
size 1048576                       <- plaintext whole-file size
sha256 <plaintext whole-file sha>  <- plaintext whole-file SHA-256
encryption 1                       <- container format version
part-encrypted <plaintext-sha256> <plaintext-size> <stored-size> <stored-sha256> <name>
```

A pointer is **wholly encrypted or wholly not**: the parser refuses a mix, and
refuses an `encryption` line with no encrypted parts under it, so one readable
part can never sit inside a file the user was told is protected. It also refuses
a `stored-size` that is not strictly larger than the plaintext size, because a
container is a header, a salt, a nonce, and a tag wrapped around what it
protects and can never be as small as it. An older Desktop Material reading a
new encrypted pointer sees six head lines, fails the parse, and treats the file
as ordinary text — which is the correct fail-closed outcome, since it could not
decrypt it anyway. Cloud compression is likewise inert on these pointers: the
Action's parser refuses them, so no run tries to deflate ciphertext.

### How a pin encrypts

An encrypted pin always takes the **part-record route**, even for one asset,
because the stored container's size and digest have nowhere else to live. Parts
are cut at **64 MiB** rather than the raw 500 MiB, and that smaller bound is
deliberate: a GCM tag covers the whole message, so a container is sealed and
re-opened as a whole buffer rather than streamed — handing out plaintext before
the tag verifies would be handing out unauthenticated bytes. Peak memory for one
part is therefore about three times the part size, and 64 MiB keeps that near
200 MiB instead of near 1.5 GiB. The trade is more assets, more key derivations,
and a slower pin; it is stated here rather than hidden.

Each part is **sealed, then immediately re-opened and compared against the
plaintext it came from, before anything is uploaded.** This is the last moment
at which an unopenable container is a recoverable problem rather than a
destroyed file, so it costs a second key derivation per part on purpose. Only
then is the container uploaded; only then does its record enter the pointer.

Asset reuse is switched off entirely while encrypting. A bucket asset's size and
digest can never match a plaintext part's, and a fresh salt and nonce per call
mean re-sealing identical bytes is never byte-identical anyway — matching on the
plaintext digest there would adopt some other file's ciphertext. Sealed
containers are operation-owned scratch, removed on success, failure, and abort
alike, so a canceled encrypted pin leaves no ciphertext of the user's file
behind.

### How a restore decrypts

Three gates, in this order, on every part:

1. the **stored container's recorded size and SHA-256** — checked with no
   passphrase in scope, so a corrupted or swapped download is reported as
   exactly that instead of being blamed on the passphrase, and no memory-hard
   derivation is spent on bytes that already failed;
2. the **GCM tag**, which is the authority on authenticity. A flipped byte, a
   truncation, and a nonce spliced from a sibling payload each raise, and the
   partial plaintext `update()` produced is discarded because unauthenticated
   bytes are not a result;
3. the **recorded plaintext size and SHA-256**, then the existing whole-file
   size and digest check after reassembly.

Any one of the three failing leaves the committed pointer exactly where it was.
**A wrong passphrase and a tampered payload fail identically and deliberately** —
telling them apart tells an attacker which half they got right — and neither the
real nor the attempted passphrase ever appears in a message, a log line, or a
notification body. A pointer naming encrypted assets that reaches a restore path
with no passphrase resolver is refused outright rather than partially restored.

### Remembering the passphrase, and the one place it must never go

Saving is **off by default**, offered as an unticked checkbox beside the
passphrase field, and scoped per repository — never one global passphrase reused
everywhere. When it is on, the passphrase is written to the **OS credential
vault through `TokenStore`** (keytar; Windows Credential Manager here), the same
place GitHub tokens already live.

> [!WARNING]
> **The profile settings store is forbidden for this value.** Desktop Material's
> settings are committed into an app-owned Git repository with retained history
> and undo (`app/src/lib/profiles/profile-git.ts`, driven by the allowlist in

`app/src/lib/cheap-lfs/payload-encryption-credentials.ts` therefore imports
`../stores/token-store` and nothing else of that kind — no
`profileSettingsRegistry`, no `profile-git`, no `profile-store`, no
`localStorage`, no settings file. Focused tests prove that leaving **Save** off
prompts again for every operation and never calls the vault writer.

The repository preferences carry only the boolean
`cheapLfsPayloadEncryption` and `cheapLfsPayloadEncryptionConfirmed` flags,
both absent by default. There is no string field anywhere in that record a
passphrase could land in.

**Vault trouble fails closed to asking, never to a file.** keytar throws on some
configurations, a locked keychain refuses reads, and a vault can be missing;
every one of those resolves to "we do not have a saved passphrase, so ask" —
there is deliberately no fallback store and no cache file. **Forget** deletes the
vault entry and is reachable from the same surface that offered to save it; when
the vault refuses the deletion the app says the entry may still exist rather
than claiming a deletion it cannot prove.

An unsaved passphrase is **operation-scoped, not session-scoped**. Upload and
materialization open the existing masked popup, use its independently owned
buffer for that one operation, overwrite it in `finally`, and prompt again next
time. Canceling refuses the operation before provider access and never uploads
readable bytes. A saved credential that cannot authenticate is not retried
silently: the app asks before removing the stale vault entry, asks for a
replacement, and saves that replacement only after decryption verifies.

### The confirmation gate

Turning the setting on does not toggle it. It opens a modal that must be got
through first, because this is the one Cheap LFS mistake that cannot be undone:

- the irreversibility sentence is a **fixed string with no funny-level
  variants**, in both languages — *"there is no reset, no backup key, no
  recovery code, and nobody at Desktop Material or GitHub can open them for
  you."* The surrounding framing carries the per-language playfulness bands; the
  consequence does not, because there is no level of humour at which "you cannot
  get this back" is allowed to read as a maybe;
- what the committed pointer still discloses is stated here too, before consent
  rather than after;
- the passphrase is typed **twice** into real `type="password"` inputs and
  compared before anything is enabled. It is never accepted from a command-line
  argument, an environment variable, or a URL, and the modules involved contain
  no reference to `process.argv`, `process.env`, or URL parameters at all;
- what saving costs — *anyone who can sign in to this machine account can
  decrypt these files* — is shown next to the save checkbox, before it is
  ticked;
- confirming requires its own explicit acknowledgement checkbox, and only
  confirming writes both the enabled flag and the acknowledgement.

The middle state is handled rather than assumed away. If a preferences record
says encryption is enabled while the acknowledgement is missing, the pin
**refuses**: a user whose settings say "encrypted" and whose release holds
plaintext is worse off than one whose pin failed with a reason. Progress is
reported through ordinary non-blocking notifications; only the gate itself and
the passphrase prompt are modal.

## Private scratch and the owned-artifact rule

Cheap LFS writes files of its own while it works. **Cheap LFS's own artifacts
are never pin, upload, commit, or inventory candidates**, at any size. One
shared predicate in `app/src/lib/cheap-lfs/owned-artifacts.ts` recognises all
of them, and every scan consults that one predicate rather than repeating a
pattern:

| Artifact | Shape | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payload staging temp (download, decompression, reassembly) | `.cheeplfs-<16 hex>.tmp` | `<git-dir>/desktop-material/cheap-lfs-scratch/session-<pid>-<hex>/` |
| Pointer-text staging temp | `.cheeplfs-<16 hex>.tmp` | beside the tracked file, in the working tree |
| Compare-and-exchange recovery directory | `.<name>.cheap-lfs-recovery-<pid>-<uuid>/` with `original` and `replacement` inside | beside the tracked file, in the working tree |
| Manual-upload verification download | `.verify-<16 hex>.tmp` | the OS temporary directory |

Payload temps are multi-gigabyte, so they are staged **outside the working
tree**, in a directory the app creates and owns outright under the repository's
git directory. The publishing `rename()` must stay atomic, so that private area
is used only after the app proves it shares a device with the repository root;
on a split device (a linked worktree whose git directory sits on another volume)
the temp stays an in-tree sibling and relies on the exclusions below instead.
The pointer temp and the recovery directory must be same-device siblings of the
file they replace — the recovery directory quarantines the user's original by
rename so a failed publish can roll it back — so those two stay in the working
tree by design.

The exclusions apply in `selectCheapLfsAutoPinTargets`, in both pointer scans
(the `git grep` inventory and the disk-walk fallback, which never descends into
a recovery directory), in `pinFileToRelease` and `planCheapLfsManualUpload` as
fail-closed backstops before any transfer, and in the working-directory status
projection so an artifact is never offered as a change to stage. Each repository
open, add, clone, or post-pull also refreshes a managed block in the
repository's private `.git/info/exclude`, so an artifact orphaned by a crash
cannot be picked up by `git add -A`, by the app's own staging, or by the user's
tooling. `info/exclude` is local-only and never committed.

**Which way this fails.** Recognition is shape-based and fail-closed *for
actions*: anything shaped like an artifact is never uploaded, pinned, or staged,
whether or not this run created it. Skipping a path is a no-op on the bytes,
while acting on one would publish private scratch to the user's release.
Deletion is the opposite — provenance-based: the crash sweep only clears session
directories inside the app-owned scratch tree, and in-tree temps are removed
only by the failure paths that created them. A user file that genuinely carries
one of these names is therefore never deleted; if it is tracked by Git it keeps
its full status, diff, and commit behaviour, because both the status filter and
`info/exclude` apply only to untracked paths, and `git add -f` still works.

Without this rule, a clone's automatic materialization and a concurrent
commit collided: the in-flight download appeared as a new multi-gigabyte
untracked file, automatic pinning selected it, and the app uploaded its own
scratch to the user's release — failing when materialize renamed the temp away
mid-upload (issue #65).

## Asset naming and the UTF-8 byte budget

Release asset names and labels are budgeted in **UTF-8 bytes**, not in
JavaScript string length. A JavaScript string counts UTF-16 code units, so a
200-character Chinese file name reads as "200" but encodes to 600 bytes, and an
emoji costs four bytes for its two code units. GitHub publishes the number 255
for asset names and labels without stating its unit, and this project has never
probed the live API to settle it, so the byte reading is adopted deliberately as
the fail-closed one: it is never looser than a character budget, so at worst it
shortens a non-ASCII name GitHub would have accepted, whereas a character budget
would offer GitHub a 765-byte name and be refused *after* the transfer had
begun — in a multi-part pin, partway through a batch, with assets already on the
release. Since this app is built for Cantonese-speaking users, CJK file names are
ordinary input rather than an edge case.

`truncateToUtf8ByteBudget` and `keepUtf8ByteTail` (`app/src/lib/utf8-budget.ts`)
do all the trimming and cut only on code-point boundaries, so a surrogate pair
is never halved and the result always re-encodes as well-formed UTF-8. The
contract every naming site holds to:

- **The suffix is never truncated.** `.partNNN`, `.deflate`, and any
  disambiguating content hash are what make a name resolvable and unique. Only
  the base is trimmed, and the multipart budget reserves the `.partNNN` tail up
  front so the whole family fits once each part name is formed.
- **The source base name is trimmed before it is validated,** not after, so a
  long CJK file name shortens instead of being refused outright. Nothing is lost:
  the asset name only records where the bytes are parked, and the committed
  pointer keeps the file's real path in full.
- **Truncation collisions are still separated by content.** Two different long
  names that trim to the same bytes are pulled apart by `dedupeAssetName` and
  `dedupeMultiPartBaseName`, which append a short SHA-256 prefix and then a
  numbered variant, re-trimming the base each time so the result stays in budget.
- **Labels follow the same rule.** A label ends with the tracked path, which is
  exactly where non-ASCII text lives, so its over-long path is elided by bytes
  behind the leading `...` marker, keeping the recognizable tail.
- **The pointer parser is deliberately still character-measured.** No string
  spends fewer bytes than it has code units, so 255 characters is the *wider*
  bound and accepts everything the byte-budgeted writer can now produce.
  Tightening it would orphan pointers written by earlier versions under the old
  character rule — a 247-character CJK base plus `.part001` is 749 bytes, and
  those files are already pinned and already committed. A parser may widen what
  it accepts; it must never narrow it.
- **The tracked-path segment check is also still character-measured,** because
  it describes the *local filesystem* rather than GitHub. NTFS and APFS both
  count 255 name units the way JavaScript does, so a 200-character Chinese file
  name is a real, creatable file on the platforms this app ships to;
  re-measuring in bytes would import ext4's 255-byte `NAME_MAX` and start
  refusing to track files the user can see in Explorer.

Cheap LFS therefore keeps every same-directory recovery name independent of
the tracked basename. Pin, Release restore, OCI restore, and the generated
clone hydrator use bounded process/UUID sidecars such as
`.entry.cheap-lfs-recovery-<pid>-<uuid>` and
`.cheap-lfs-hydrate-<pid>-<uuid>`. Older builds instead prepended the full
tracked basename; a valid 200-unit name could become a 256-unit sidecar and
fail with `ENAMETOOLONG`. Extended-length `\\?\` paths, Git `core.longpaths`,
8.3 aliases, and a shallower checkout cannot bypass NTFS's 255-unit
**per-component** limit. On an older build, the practical workaround is to
temporarily rename that one tracked basename to at most 100 units, complete the
pin or restore, then commit the intended path rename or move it back after the
pointer is safely written.

Materialized Cheap LFS payloads create a separate ordinary-Git pull boundary:
Desktop can prove and project their raw bytes as clean, but Git still compares
those bytes with the pointer in the index and may refuse an incoming overwrite.
For a path that Large files & storage explicitly marks **Materialized** (never
**Modified**), the current safe workaround is to copy the raw payload outside
the repository, restore that path's worktree copy from `HEAD`, pull, and then
run **Materialize all** again. Keep the backup until the new materialization is
verified; never apply this to an edited or unproven file. Ordinary changes may
be stashed separately, but the multi-gigabyte materialized payloads themselves
should not be packed into a Git stash. The app does not silently run that
destructive conversion from the Pull button.

Manual release-asset uploads in the Releases view split the difference. The name
the picker suggests from the chosen file is trimmed to the byte budget, so a
long CJK file name still opens the upload panel with an editable name rather
than refusing the file outright. The name the user then confirms is validated,
not trimmed: for a published artifact the name is the user's own deliberate
choice, so an over-budget one is reported before the transfer starts rather than
silently renamed behind their back.

## First publish: anchoring the release before any upload

A GitHub Release tag can only be created against a commit GitHub already has.
`resolveReleaseTargetCommitish` returns the *local* branch name, so on a
repository whose branch has never been pushed `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/
releases` answers `422 Validation Failed` for every selected file — the release
route needs a published commit, and publishing needs the pinned commit.

**Design chosen: publish the branch tip before uploading, then prove it.**
`ensureCheapLfsReleaseAnchor` runs once per commit, before any hashing or
upload, and consults the pure decision in
`app/src/lib/cheap-lfs/first-publish.ts`:

| Decision | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ready` | `ls-remote` proved the branch exists remotely | upload |
| `publish-branch` | GitHub repository, remote, branch, and tip all exist locally, but the branch is unpublished | push the tip with `expectedRemoteSha: null`, re-read the remote ref, then upload |
| `bootstrap-commit` | repository, remote, and branch exist but the branch is unborn | create one empty bootstrap commit, then publish it as above |
| `blocked-no-github-repository` | no GitHub repository backs the checkout | refuse, per-file reason |
| `blocked-no-remote` | no push remote configured | refuse, per-file reason |
| `blocked-detached-head` | no branch to publish | refuse, per-file reason |
| `blocked-unborn-branch` | the bootstrap commit itself was refused | refuse, per-file reason |

The bootstrap push reuses the existing batching session primitive
(`operations.push` with `expectedRemoteSha: null`, which asserts the branch does
not exist yet), so it can only ever *create* the branch and can never overwrite
someone else's work. Success is never inferred from the push exit status:
`isCheapLfsFirstPublishProven` re-reads the remote ref and requires it to equal
the exact tip that was pushed. This matches the existing "each batch pushed and
proven" contract already used by automatic commit-push batching.

The alternative — deferring asset upload to the push phase and committing
pointers marked pending-upload — was rejected. It would commit pointers whose
bytes exist nowhere remote, so any clone taken between that commit and the later
push would resolve to a dangling pointer. There is no silent fallback to another
storage provider: a blocking decision refuses, names the reason on every
affected file row and in the notification, and leaves the raw files selected in
Changes for a retry.

### A completely empty repository is bootstrapped, not refused

An unborn branch used to be a blocking decision, which made a genuinely empty
repository unreachable: there was nothing to publish, so no release could be
anchored, so no large file could ever be pinned. Worse, GitHub answers
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases` with `[]` for a repository that has **no
commits at all** — even when releases exist on it — so nothing the app could
read while in that state was trustworthy either.

`createCheapLfsBootstrapCommit` therefore creates exactly one commit through the
ordinary `createCommit` machinery:

- `--allow-empty` with an empty index. **No file content is ever invented** —
  the app does not write a README, a `.gitattributes`, or a placeholder.
- Message `Initialize repository for Cheap LFS / 開荒留名`, bilingual like every
  other commit note this project writes, so the history says why it exists.
- The app's ordinary author identity and the repository's ordinary hooks. A
  hook that refuses aborts the bootstrap with
  `cheapLfs.firstPublish.unbornBranch` plus the underlying detail, rather than
  waiting on a prompt nobody is watching.

Only the branch state is reloaded afterwards (`GitStore.loadBranches`), never a
full repository refresh: the commit the user actually asked for is still holding
its own working-directory selection. The publication state is then re-read, and
the ordinary `publish-branch` push publishes the new tip.

### The review fingerprint is taken *after* the anchor

The hidden-inventory behavior above is not merely a stale read, it is a wrong
one, and it produced a real end-to-end abort: the pre-commit review saw `[]`,
the anchor push then un-hid three pre-existing buckets mid-flight, and the
per-mutation review guard correctly refused every upload with *“The reviewed
release, asset, repository, or account changed.”*

The order is therefore fixed:

1. `ensureCheapLfsReleaseAnchor` guarantees the remote holds at least one
   commit — bootstrapping one if the local repository is empty — and reports
   `anchored: true` only when it actually published something proven.
2. `trackAndRefreshAfterCheapLfsAnchor` records the tracking ref and upstream
   and refreshes branch, remote, and status state (see below).
3. `reviewCheapLfsReleaseInventory` re-fetches the complete inventory through
   `GitHubReleasesStore.listAll` and `takeCheapLfsReleaseReview` fingerprints
   it. A walk truncated by `CheapLfsReleaseInventoryMaximumPages`, or an
   unreadable inventory, yields **no** review rather than a false one.
4. Only then does pinning start, carrying that review in
   `ICheapLfsPinOptions.releaseReview`.

`allocateCheapLfsReleaseBucket` uses the review to stay fail-closed for anything
that changes *after* it: a bucket the review proved exists, which the live
lookup can no longer see, aborts instead of being created a second time. Every
mutation still revalidates its own reviewed release before it runs — uploads
through the append guard described next, everything else through the unchanged
whole-payload comparison.

An **already-published repository is untouched by all of this**. It returns
`anchored: false`, takes no extra review, issues no extra request, and pins
exactly as it did before.

### Uploading is guarded as an append, not as a replacement

`GitHubReleasesStore.uploadAsset` is the one mutation that only *adds* to a
release, and it is revalidated by `revalidateReviewedReleaseForAppend` rather
than by the whole-payload `revalidateReviewedRelease` that `update`, `publish`,
`delete`, `deleteAsset`, and `updateAssetLabel` still use verbatim.

The whole-payload comparison is unsatisfiable for an append and proves nothing
about its safety. The reviewed snapshot is read from `GET /releases/tags/{tag}`
and the revalidation from `GET /releases/{id}`; the `assets` array both carry is
a preview, not an authority; a batch necessarily observes the siblings it
uploaded a moment earlier; the provenance annotator rewrites sibling labels; the
cloud-compression workflow posts `.deflate` siblings; and a public asset's
`download_count` moves whenever any stranger fetches it. A 15.8 GiB batch pin
therefore failed file after file with *“The reviewed release, asset, repository,
or account changed”* when nothing meaningful had changed at all (issue #56).

The append guard is still fail-closed. It requires, in order:

1. **Release identity unchanged** — `getGitHubReleaseIdentityFingerprint` covers
   id, tag, target commitish, name, body, draft and prerelease state, created
   and published timestamps, author, and URL. A re-tagged, re-created,
   re-drafted, or body-rewritten release still aborts.
2. **Every reviewed asset still present and intact** —
   `getGitHubReleaseAssetIdentityFingerprint` covers id, name, state, content
   type, size, and digest. A deleted, renamed, re-typed, resized, or rewritten
   sibling still aborts, which keeps the compression workflow's `DELETE`
   correctly fatal.
3. **The target name is free** — an asset that appeared *after* the review and
   holds the name being uploaded aborts, unless its digest is exactly the digest
   this caller is uploading. That one case is the label-drop retry finding its
   own already-completed upload, which is idempotent rather than fatal.
4. Anything else is tolerated: siblings that merely appeared, and sibling
   `label`, `download_count`, or `updated_at` values that moved.

Two supporting changes keep the two sides of the comparison honest. Both
`fetchRelease` and `fetchReleaseByTag` now pass `reloadCache: true`, so the
reviewed snapshot and the revalidation can never be served from different
generations of GitHub's `max-age=60` cache. And `annotateCheapLfsPinnedAssets`
splices each `updateAssetLabel` response back into the release snapshot it
caches per tag, because relabeling one asset invalidates any review of that
release taken before it — previously only the first asset of each release was
ever annotated and the rest were silently counted as skipped. Annotation passes
are also serialized per repository in `AppStore`, so a pass that is deliberately
not awaited can never overlap the next one on the same buckets.

### The anchor push does not run `pre-push`

The bootstrap push is issued with `--no-verify`. It is generated by the app, not
authored by the user: it publishes a branch tip the user has already committed,
only ever *creates* a ref, and exists solely so a Release tag has a commitish.
Running the user's `pre-push` hook for a publication they never requested gives
the hook no decision to make while letting an unrelated hook failure block the
entire large-file route — which is exactly what happened in a repository
carrying the stock Git LFS hooks. The user's own reviewed push, and every batch
push that publishes their commits, still runs every hook. See [Git hook
execution environment](../quality-and-reliability/git-hook-execution.md) for the
separate defect that made those hooks fail under the bundled Windows Git.

### An aborted anchor is never silent

`ensureCheapLfsReleaseAnchor` returns the localized reason key **and** the
underlying cause (typically Git's own message). Returning only a key used to
strand the real failure in a `log.warn` nobody reads: the commit aborted
without touching a single file, the button simply sprang back, and neither the
terminal nor a notification said why.

`buildCheapLfsFirstPublishAbort` now derives all three surfaces from one
failure so they cannot drift apart or be forgotten:

- **per-file rows** carrying `reasonKey` plus `reasonDetail`,
- a **terminal progress snapshot** stating `failed = n`, `succeeded = 0`, and
  the same reason on every row, so the commit terminal states why it stopped,
- a **persistent, non-blocking notice** with the same text, deduplicated per
  repository.

The notice is enqueued directly onto the notice stack rather than through
`emitError`, because `emitError` honors the user's error-presentation
preference and can become a modal dialog — a background abort must never block
the app, and must never be silent either. `reasonDetail` is passed through
`sanitizeCheapLfsFailureReason` before display, so a Git message containing a
credential-bearing URL or token is scrubbed on every one of those surfaces.

### The toolbar stops offering “Publish branch” after the anchor

The anchor push is an exact `<sha>:refs/heads/<branch>` refspec, which
deliberately cannot overwrite anyone's work — but it also sets no tracking, so
the toolbar kept offering **Publish branch** for a branch it had just published,
with no ahead/behind at all. `trackAndRefreshAfterCheapLfsAnchor` closes that
gap immediately after the push is proven: it writes
`refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>` to the tip `ls-remote` just proved, sets
`branch.<name>` to track it, then reloads remotes, branches, and status in that
order — ahead/behind comes from the `git status` branch header, so it is read
last. Both Git writes are best effort and logged on failure: the uploads already
succeeded and must never be lost to a cosmetic toolbar state.

A fresh-session fallback now repairs that cosmetic state even when an older
session wrote the exact remote-tracking ref but stopped before writing
`branch.*` configuration. After either remotes or status load, `GitStore`
reapplies one shared fallback that compares the canonical local branch ref with
only the same-named ref on the actual default push remote. This ordering matters:
the anchor path reloads remotes and then status, and the second refresh must not
erase the proved publication state.
An equal tip yields `ahead 0 / behind 0`; later local work yields the real ahead
count, so the toolbar offers Push instead of falsely returning to **Publish
branch**. A missing exact ref—or the same branch name on a different remote—
keeps the unpublished state. The branch's upstream remains null so the next
real push still records the missing configuration with `--set-upstream`.

Real-Git fresh-store tests cover equal and one-ahead tips, a follow-up status
refresh, a missing exact ref, and a wrong-remote lookalike. This is the restart
regression tracked in issue
[#39](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/issues/39).

## Why a pin failed: per-file reasons

Every counted failure carries its cause all the way to the UI. A pin failure
records the provider's HTTP status (`cheapLfsFailureStatusCode` reads
`responseStatus` from `GitHubReleasesError`/`APIError`) alongside its message,
and `ICheapLfsAutoPinProgress.failedFileDetails` republishes both on every
progress snapshot so the Cheap LFS commit terminal can never settle on a bare
`pinned 0 · failed 10`.

Provider text is bounded and scrubbed by `sanitizeCheapLfsFailureReason` before
display: control characters are collapsed so nothing can forge terminal output,
URLs are stripped outright (release and upload URLs can carry query tokens),
`gh*_`/`github_pat_` tokens and `Authorization: Bearer …` values are removed
rather than echoed, and one reason is capped at 240 characters. A reason this
app diagnosed itself is carried as a `reasonKey` instead and always wins over
relayed provider text, so an unpublished repository reads as guidance rather
than as a raw `422`. All copy is available in English and Cantonese and stays
plain and factual at every funny level.

## Failure modes and recovery

An unavailable Releases account, missing release or asset, stale release
review, upload/download error, missing trusted GitHub CLI, CLI
failure, changed source file, digest or size mismatch, oversized pointer
projection, invalid part layout, insufficient temporary space, or cancellation
before pointer commit leaves the original source or tracked pointer in place.
An existing stable or otherwise unrecognized Release at the requested tag also
fails before publish, upload, or pointer replacement and asks for another tag.
Failed multipart pins attempt to delete only assets uploaded by that
attempt and report any cleanup failure without touching pre-existing assets.
CLI-unavailable, CLI-failed, and incomplete-asset messages direct the user to
retry or use the explicit manual handoff.

A filesystem without the required no-overwrite hard-link operation, a changed
parent directory, or a concurrent destination mutation also fails closed. The
app restores the exact quarantined original when that can be done without
overwriting another process. If either identity cannot be restored or removed
safely, both files remain in the surfaced private recovery directory for manual
review.

A group requiring more than 1,000 assets is rejected before hashing or Release
mutation. A concurrent uploader can consume capacity after allocation; if the
provider then rejects the upload, the operation fails without splitting the
group and applies the same attempt-owned cleanup. Incomplete provider records
such as `starter` still reserve capacity and names, but are shown as processing
and are never accepted as uploaded, downloaded, or materialized. When an upload
response creates an object the app cannot accept, the isolated transfer process
also makes a best-effort authenticated deletion of that exact returned asset ID.
The CLI recovery never uses a clobber operation and never deletes an ambiguous
object discovered after a timed-out native request.

One automatic materialization failure is recorded per pointer and does not
stop the remaining batch; cancellation stops the batch and the summary reports
what stayed as pointers. Automatic pin workers likewise collect ordinary
per-file failures and continue the other lanes. Successfully written pointers
and unrelated selected changes may commit, while every failed raw file is
explicitly removed from that commit and remains visible for retry. Cancellation
stops new lane work, aborts and drains all active workers, and creates no
misleading partial commit. An all-failed selection never becomes an accidental
empty commit.

The manual handoff waits for a bounded roughly six-hour window and scans every
bounded Release-asset page. A timeout, cancel, changed source, missing or
duplicate expected name, wrong size or digest, download mismatch, or
pointer-write failure aborts the commit. Cancellation is fenced immediately
before pointer commit; after the first per-file atomic write begins, the app
finishes the reviewed writes instead of reporting a misleading canceled result.
A later pointer-write failure can leave earlier files as valid pointers, but
the commit is aborted and status is refreshed. Files pinned before the switch
remain valid pointers. Assets that the user uploaded in the browser are left on
the Release for explicit review; the app never treats them as attempt-owned
assets that it may delete automatically.
An exact-name `starter` or other incomplete preexisting object still consumes
Release capacity but never counts as completed upload progress; the error asks
the user to wait for it or delete it in the Release editor before retrying.

Cloud compression validates the raw asset's recorded size and SHA-256 before
compressing. A download, compression, upload, verification, branch-protection,
concurrent-push, or network failure leaves the remote pointer and raw asset
unchanged. A result that is not strictly smaller is a successful safe skip.
The job continues with later objects, reports each failure in the Actions
summary, and fails the run after all candidates have had an independent chance.
An unadopted attempt asset is deleted when ownership is exact; cleanup failure
can leave only a harmless redundant side asset. The original raw asset is
retained even after success so historical pointer commits remain materializable.

The visible **Cancel** action asks for confirmation before it signals any
active automatic upload or manual handoff. Declining the prompt does not touch
the transfer controller, cancel request, or commit state. Confirming signals
cancellation exactly once and explains that worktree files already converted
to pointers or assets already accepted by GitHub may remain even though the app
will not create the commit. The confirmation is available in English, playful
Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual mode.

## Security considerations

Tracked paths must retain their exact reviewed Windows spelling. Absolute,
drive-rooted, UNC, parent-traversing, empty, dot, Git-metadata, overlong, and
control-character paths are rejected, as are Windows device basenames,
alternate-data-stream colons, other illegal characters, and components ending
in a dot or space. A batch also rejects duplicate or case-colliding
destinations. The canonical repository root and each regular parent directory
are identity-checked at every mutation boundary, so symlink, junction, reparse,
or concurrently redirected parents fail closed. Pointer text is strictly
parsed, capped at 512 KiB, and validates canonical sizes, lowercase SHA-256
values, ordered part totals, and release asset bounds.

Production automatic Release and OCI upload preparation opens the proved
source without following links, hashes it into an operation-owned private copy,
and uploads only that copy. The original source and destination proofs are
revalidated after staging and immediately before provider publication and
pointer replacement. Asset uploads also use exact account-bound Release
mutation reviews, refreshing the Release snapshot before each later part.
Release mutation additionally requires recognizable bucket provenance:
published-prerelease status plus either the exact current body sentinel or a
valid legacy asset label. A tag match, title, or prose mention is never enough,
and read-only restore does not auto-publish an unrecognized draft.

Private prerelease assets remain available only to users authorized for the
repository. Explicitly public GitHub.com repositories use a blank-token,
read-only Release context for metadata and asset downloads; the main process
omits the `Authorization` header. Unknown/private visibility and GitHub
Enterprise still require the exact repository-selected account. Anonymous
create, update, publish, delete, upload, and mutation-review operations are
rejected before transport.

Cloud compression installs its managed workflow into a private repository only
after the persisted private opt-in. The setting discloses the private Actions
minute cost before consent. The run uses only that calling repository's
`github.token`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, Release API, and `origin`; it does not carry
a cross-repository target or provider credential. The exact default-branch and
live visibility checks run before compression, and the managed caller is pinned
to reviewed action commits. Visibility that GitHub has not confirmed is a
reported hard stop: no workflow is created or armed. Public prerelease assets
remain outside the stable Latest release. The feature never puts provider
credentials in a pointer. Temporary downloads are cleaned on success and
failure, and unverified bytes never replace a tracked file.

Optional payload encryption keeps its passphrase in the OS credential vault
only, never in the Git-backed profile settings store, a preferences file,
`localStorage`, a log line, a notification body, an error message, `argv`, an
environment variable, or a URL. A vault that is missing, locked, or throwing
falls back to asking each time and never to a plaintext copy. A wrong passphrase
and a tampered payload fail identically, and neither produces a partial write:
the stored container's recorded size and digest are proved before any key is
derived, the GCM tag is proved before any plaintext is returned, and the
recorded plaintext size and digest are proved before anything replaces a tracked
file. The committed pointer still records the plaintext size and SHA-256 in the
clear, which is a confirmation oracle for a guessed file and is disclosed in the
confirmation gate rather than left to be discovered.

GitHub CLI recovery accepts only the trusted well-known installation path; it
does not search the current directory or `PATH`. The exact account token is
placed in `GH_TOKEN` or `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` only for the owned child process,
with prompting, telemetry, update checks, color, inherited `GH_*`/`GITHUB_*`
credentials, and debug output disabled. Standard output and standard error are
bounded and never surfaced as credential-bearing diagnostics. Application quit
stops accepting new Release transfers, aborts all active native or CLI work,
and waits for their teardown through the owned-process shutdown barrier.

Manual mode snapshots every pre-existing asset ID through all ten bounded pages
before opening the handoff. It accepts a new exact-name and exact-size asset or
an explicitly planned reusable ID with the expected size and digest. A reusable
asset without a provider digest is downloaded and hashed before it can count.
The complete paginated inventory is freshly checked when assets count and again
immediately before pointer writes, fencing deletion, replacement, state, size,
and digest changes. New browser assets are downloaded and hashed, then every
source is re-hashed before any pointer is written. Cross-file asset names are
reserved as one batch, including duplicate basenames from different subfolders.
The release URL is supplied by GitHub, checked against the account-bound
provider origin and repository path, and converted only from its validated
`/releases/tag/<slug>` route to `/releases/edit/<slug>`; no token is placed in
the browser URL. Handoff cleanup removes only the random directory entries whose
filesystem identities the operation created, so a replaced path is not
deleted.

The managed cloud caller grants only `contents: write`, runs on the default
branch, serializes runs per repository and ref without canceling an in-flight
object, and never places the app's OAuth token in a workflow input, argument,
artifact, cache, or pointer. Asset names and pointer paths are passed as process
and HTTP values rather than interpolated shell programs. Existing unowned
workflow content at the managed path is never overwritten.

## Verification

The July 27 combined browser, restore, IPC, localization, and private-badge
gate passed **652/652 across 53 files**. It supersedes the earlier **42/42**
restore-progress and **15/15** operations/AppStore checkpoints while retaining
their exact 899/1000-versus-900/1000 threshold, reduced-motion, and
narrow-layout coverage. The two verifier contract suites passed **14/14**,
full TypeScript was clean, and the exact Windows production build returned
zero with no timeout or stderr. A real built app on an isolated hidden Win32
desktop passed wide English and narrow bilingual restore receipts at the
current-90% / look-ahead-10% state without clipping, overlap, or private data.
The source and four new raw-main evidence assets are pushed through
`2abccae8fd`, and Pages/wiki publication and packaged Windows E2E are verified.
Installer/Release evidence remained pending at that dated checkpoint; archived
Linux TUI compatibility work is non-blocking under the current Windows-only
product boundary.

### Live GitHub and Desktop Material UI acceptance — 2026-07-22

Live acceptance used one retained public repository and one retained private
repository on the authenticated `DingDingChae` account. The production app
materialized and re-pinned deterministic 1,048,576-byte payloads through the
Large files panel and native Windows picker. The resulting five-line pointers
are pushed on each repository's `main` branch at public commit
`a7c90eff6a4d7963577125e3204a1b9af28da756` and private commit
`e56519d4742c63bb2c9f5f1e917de3fca7379fdd`.

Fresh clones resolved to those exact UI commits, retained the pointer text, and
reported no `git lfs ls-files` entries. All original and UI-created Release
assets report the expected size and SHA-256. The user explicitly authorized a
temporary bridge from the logged-in GitHub CLI account into Desktop Material's
development secure store; the token was never printed, logged, captured, or
committed, and the exact entry was deleted and verified absent after the runs.
Detailed asset IDs, pointer line-ending sizes, hashes, screenshot evidence, and
cleanup observations are in the record:

### Live 14.8 GB Bambu build acceptance — 2026-07-23

The real Changes UI added the managed public caller at `fc1bedb`. Cloud run
[`30048474438`](https://github.com/codingmachineedge/bambu-build/actions/runs/30048474438)
reported 13 compressed, 0 kept raw, and 0 failed, then ended its 13 pointer-only
commits at `ce438aa`. Independently, the release retained 9,428,683,391 raw
bytes and added
1,491,654,444 compressed bytes: 13 raw plus 13 compressed assets, so old raw
pointers remain restorable.

Verifier run `30048474451` failed as expected because the repository did not
yet include its authoritative manifest. The real UI then pushed exactly the
manifest and bilingual action-pin update at `712ad85`. Verifier run
[`30054805137`](https://github.com/codingmachineedge/bambu-build/actions/runs/30054805137)
passed 8,305 payload files, ten pointers, and 26 assets, and published immutable
release
[`bambu-build-verify-30054805137`](https://github.com/codingmachineedge/bambu-build/releases/tag/bambu-build-verify-30054805137)
with a 5,489-byte manifest asset whose SHA-256 is
`234e88a446073d59c293e40966b6cbcfa080e21467fe14df840452d0c04694b3`.
Final cloud run `30054805097` was a clean 0-compressed, 0-kept-raw,
0-failed-safe no-op.

A fresh real-UI clone at exact `712ad85` locally decompressed all ten paths to
their original 10/10 SHA-256 values while the committed Git objects remained
pointer blobs of 374, 506, 500, 370, 380, 371, 374, 514, 378, and 379 bytes in
the UI's path order. The initial Materialize-all action overlapped automatic
clone/open materialization and produced two exact CAS recovery duplicates. The
integrity proof passed, but that concurrency behavior was not accepted:
repository-scoped serialization was added. A deterministic real-Git overlap
regression now proves the shared queue, exact cancellation ownership, in-lock
pointer refresh, and rejection-tolerant release. The promoted live inventory
frame documents the ten-pointer UI, while this clone receipt remains the exact
10/10 byte proof.

### Live cloud-compression acceptance — 2026-07-22

The production Large files UI added the reviewed public caller in commit
[`72b2db3e0b6554364e07e5e34945c8be5c125216`](https://github.com/DingDingChae/desktop-material-cheap-lfs-public-20260722-153308/commit/72b2db3e0b6554364e07e5e34945c8be5c125216).
[Run `29969707165`](https://github.com/DingDingChae/desktop-material-cheap-lfs-public-20260722-153308/actions/runs/29969707165)
succeeded and pushed pointer-only bot commit
[`f10d8d2acedbba0e3b5ce978dff09c25217cad9c`](https://github.com/DingDingChae/desktop-material-cheap-lfs-public-20260722-153308/commit/f10d8d2acedbba0e3b5ce978dff09c25217cad9c).
The private UI first showed the feature off, then persisted explicit consent in
commit `3d398786dd4c599730e0dbb77b0c83a5fa14a57a`; run `29969957449`
succeeded and pushed bot commit
`6259b0fa0dc6c65cdb5a90af8e1da9358b45b0ac`.

Both resulting compressed assets are 1,033 bytes with stored SHA-256
`8d22b086820b0896bdcb33cf965ebc275cb0b5f0b4c44a364aa4144c015f9f7b`.
Their raw 1,048,576-byte source assets remain present, and per-row UI
materialization of each compressed pointer produced exactly 1,048,576 bytes
with original SHA-256
`30e14955ebf1352266dc2ff8067e68104607e750abb9d3b36582b8af909fcb58`.

Earlier public run
[`29967844734`](https://github.com/DingDingChae/desktop-material-cheap-lfs-public-20260722-153308/actions/runs/29967844734)
hit the draft-release tag-endpoint 404, reported one object failed safely, and
left both the raw pointer and asset unchanged. Desktop Material then
materialized that raw pointer through the production UI to the same exact size
and digest. The corrected Action's bounded draft lookup produced the succeeding
public and private results above. The full run, asset, pointer, screenshot, and
remaining publication record is in the cloud-compression acceptance receipt.

The focused Large files UI test derives its 500 MiB part-size copy directly
from the shared pointer constant so UI guidance cannot drift from new writes.

`cheap-lfs/pointer-test.ts` covers canonical single/multipart pointers, legacy
deflated compatibility, size limits, part totals, path normalization, and the
500 MiB-part upload plan. `cheap-lfs/operations-test.ts` covers raw uploads,
deduplicated asset names, 1,000-asset rollover without splitting groups,
mutation reviews, attempt-owned cleanup, source race checks, cancellation,
per-part and whole-file verification, paginated inventory reuse, and atomic
materialization. Its cloud cases additionally prove bounded cleanup for a
truncated DEFLATE stream, over-expansion, and exact-size wrong-hash output.
`cheap-lfs/tracked-path-store-test.ts` covers strict Windows spellings,
canonical parent-chain and link rejection, private verified upload copies,
source/destination revalidation, case-colliding batches, exclusive no-overwrite
publication, rollback, and surfaced recovery artifacts. It also pins the
racily-clean rule from both sides: a same-size rewrite after a settled capture
must move the modification time and be refused, and an identity that can never
settle must fail closed without a content proof while still publishing with one.
`cheap-lfs/cloud-compression-action-test.ts` runs the real composite action
against a temporary Git remote and fake GitHub Release API, proving a verified
side asset and `part-deflate` commit, exact raw-pointer preservation on forced
upload failure, and a non-beneficial incompressible skip. The cloud policy and
UI suites cover public automatic setup, private explicit consent, unknown
visibility, unowned-workflow refusal, symlink/junction/hardlink rejection,
atomic replacement failure, concurrent edits, repository-switch races,
immutable action pins, mixed badges, and local-only single-object
decompression.
`cheap-lfs/workflow-auto-install-test.ts` covers the background install:
every detection outcome (missing, committed-canonical, committed-divergent,
locally edited, unowned), the exact private armed and closed guard transitions,
every publish outcome (default-branch push, anchor,
defer-unpushed-commits, non-default-branch refusal, and each blocking reason),
the `workflow`-scope refusal classification, a contract test proving every
`uses:` in the canonical template is pinned by a full 40-character commit SHA,
and an end-to-end run against a real repository with a real local bare remote.
That run proves the caller is committed and the remote tip matches, exactly one
commit touching exactly one path is published, a foreign file at the path is
never rewritten, a divergent managed caller is replaced only after
confirmation, a diverged branch is committed but never pushed, and the user's
staged selection survives untouched. It also drives the same real repository
through private opt-in, private opt-out, and unknown-visibility states, proving
the reviewed guard transitions and the deduped fail-closed blocker.
`cheap-lfs/manual-upload-test.ts` covers whole-batch handoff names, atomic
bucket rollover, Windows case-insensitive reservation, live preparation
progress, free-space preflight, verified hardlink/copy staging, zero-byte and
symlink rejection, resumable multipart subsets, stale-ID fences, pagination,
pre-existing-asset exclusion, cancel-safe cleanup, remote and source hash
verification, and provider-bound Releases URLs. Release model/API and transfer
tests prove a complete 1,000-record exact response remains bounded, incomplete
objects count but cannot transfer, and the smaller multi-release response cap
is unchanged. `cheap-lfs/automation-test.ts`,
`cheap-lfs/commit-entry-points-test.ts`, and
`cheap-lfs/commit-status-refresh-test.ts` cover the 100-MiB commit gate, every
routed commit entry point, phase and byte progress, manual switching,
preference/account gating, failure aborts, and status reload before commit.
`cheap-lfs/cancel-confirmation-test.ts`, `commit-message-test.tsx`,
`cheap-lfs-test.tsx`, and
`build-run-cheap-lfs-settings-test.tsx` cover the localized manual/cancel
controls and confirmation fence, reviewed panel actions, inventory,
cancellation, progress, and persisted preferences.
`github-release-transfer-test.ts` additionally proves
chunked mode is enabled before the first Electron write, `Content-Length` is
removed only at that boundary, required headers remain, source chunks are
advanced one at a time, native network-progress sampling and stall
cancellation, trusted CLI resolution, sanitized token/config isolation,
exact-range stdin streaming and digest, GitHub.com/GHE host mapping, bounded
output/process teardown, one complete 1,000-asset scan followed by ID polling,
late completion reconciliation, fail-closed persistent `starter` handling,
one no-object clean retry, prepared-digest live verification, redacted CLI
diagnostics, automatic stall/411/502 fallback,
100%-only-after-acceptance progress, and
application-quit teardown. An earlier transfer and localization checkpoint
passed 34/34 tests (21 transfer and 13 localization), plus root TypeScript
no-emit and focused lint, format, and diff checks. The combined changed-surface
gate passed 165/165 across 18 suites.
