Desktop Material can open browser-bound HTTP and HTTPS links in a dedicated
app-hosted window instead of always handing them to the system browser. The
window supplies a URL bar, tabs, New tab, Back, Forward, Refresh/Stop, Go,
bookmarks, and an explicit **Open externally** escape while keeping remote web
content outside the trusted app renderer.

本身係鎖喺 sandbox 嘅遠端 view，掂唔到 app IPC；登入分頁更加係即用即棄，唔會畀
你加書籤。本機正式 build 同 hidden-desktop 驗收已經過關；source 同相已經經

installer/Release 憑證未完成，未可以扮成已經入咗 installer；舊 TUI correction
唔屬於而家 Windows-only 產品嘅 blocker。

## Behavior and configuration

**Settings → Advanced → Open web links** stores one global choice:

- **In the system browser** is the default and recommended choice. It avoids a
  blank app-hosted page by handing browser-bound HTTP and HTTPS links to the
  operating system's configured browser.
- **Inside Desktop Material** is an intentional opt-in. Browser-bound HTTP and
  HTTPS links open in the app-hosted window.

The choice is persisted locally, included in profile settings restore, and
applied at startup. A fresh or invalid preference resolves to the system
browser; an explicitly saved **Inside Desktop Material** choice is preserved.
Callers also provide an explicit `default` or `authentication` intent; the app
never guesses that a URL is an authentication flow from its hostname or path.

The app-hosted window has one trusted local chrome renderer and one sandboxed
`WebContentsView` per remote tab. Its controls provide:

- a labelled tab list with loading state, active-tab selection, close buttons,
  and **New tab**;
- Back, Forward, Refresh or Stop, a labelled URL field, and **Go**;
- bookmark add/remove plus a bookmark bar for ordinary tabs; and
- **Open externally** on every navigable tab.

The toolbar's search button and Ctrl+F open a non-blocking
find bar for the active page. Plain text is the default and uses Chromium's
native in-page highlighting, with case matching and previous/next navigation.
Regex is an explicit opt-in: the shared anchored regex builder supplies the
pattern, and the trusted renderer evaluates it through the bounded RE2 adapter
against capped page text read in an isolated world. Regex results show a
bounded context list and never mutate the remote page to fake highlighting.
Every request carries a renderer token; late native tallies or page-text
responses are ignored when they belong to an older query, tab, or mode.

Typing a full HTTP or HTTPS address navigates directly. A bare hostname is
promoted to HTTPS. Arbitrary words are not silently sent to a search provider.
Ordinary same-tab HTTP(S) navigation and redirects remain in that view.
`window.open` targets are captured into another app-hosted tab and the remote
popup itself is denied. Valid Desktop Material callback URLs return to the app;
the deliberately allowlisted operating-system schemes `mailto:`, `tel:`, and
`ms-settings:` go to Windows.

Authentication tabs carry a visible **SIGN IN** chip and private-session
notice. They use one in-memory partition shared only with authentication
popups, cannot be bookmarked, provide **Continue in system browser**, and close
after a valid app callback. Their session storage and cache are cleared when
the authentication browser closes.

## Persistence

The global internal/external choice and ordinary bookmarks persist in local
renderer storage. Ordinary browsing tabs use a dedicated persistent browser
partition so normal website session state can survive reopening the browser
window. Tab identities, open-tab order, and current tab URLs are in-memory only
and are not restored after the window closes.

Bookmark persistence is deliberately narrower than browsing state:

- at most 100 bookmarks and 128 KiB of serialized bookmark data are accepted;
- only credential-free HTTP(S) URLs are valid;
- query strings and fragments are removed before a bookmark is stored; and
- remote titles are de-controlled, whitespace-normalized, and capped at 160
  characters.

Authentication tabs never enter that bookmark store.

## Failure modes and recovery

The browser chrome reports invalid addresses, failed loads, certificate
failures, blocked downloads, and a stopped remote renderer without opening an
acknowledgement-only modal. Back/Forward disable when no matching history
entry exists, and Refresh becomes Stop while a page is loading.

If Windows rejects a system-browser launch, Desktop Material reports the
failure as a factual non-blocking notice without including the attempted URL.
The same detail-free path covers ordinary renderer links, native Help-menu
links, and **Open externally** from the app-hosted browser, while callers that
already present a specific error suppress the generic notice. It does not
silently fall back to the app-hosted browser. The user can retry after checking
the default browser or intentionally select **Inside Desktop Material** in
Advanced settings.

### A tab is never left unmeasured

The native page view is sized from a measurement the browser chrome takes of
its own content viewport and reports over IPC. That measurement is driven by
`requestAnimationFrame`, which Electron suspends while a window is hidden — and
the browser window is created hidden and shown only once it has finished
loading. A tab created in that gap could therefore be given a 0x0 rectangle
that nothing later corrected, producing a browser window with visible chrome
and no page at all.

Two independent guards close that gap:

- The chrome pairs every frame-scheduled measurement with a short timer
  fallback (120 ms). Timers keep running while a window is hidden, so the
  measurement is always delivered; whichever path fires first cancels the
  other, so the bounds are still reported exactly once per change.
- The main process treats a zero width or height as *not measured yet* rather
  than as a genuine zero-sized page. Until a real measurement arrives, a tab is
  given the whole content area below the chrome, and the renderer's true
  measurement refines it the moment it lands.

`resolveInternalBrowserContentBounds` in `app/src/lib/internal-browser.ts` is
the single pure function both the initial tab creation, tab activation, and
window-resize paths call, so the fallback cannot apply on one path and not
another.

The app-hosted browser intentionally does not save downloads. A download
attempt is stopped and the page explains that it must be opened externally.
Certificate errors are denied rather than bypassed. A failed or crashed page
can be refreshed or opened in the system browser; changing the global setting
returns all later browser-bound links to that browser.

## Security considerations

Remote pages never share the trusted app renderer:

- every remote view has Node integration disabled in the main frame and
  subframes, context isolation and Chromium sandboxing enabled, web security
  enabled, mixed-content execution disabled, safe dialogs enabled, and no
  preload script;
- remote web contents are not registered as trusted Desktop Material IPC
  senders;
- every Electron permission check and permission request is denied;
- popup creation and downloads are denied, while HTTP(S) popup targets are
  captured by trusted chrome;
- navigation accepts only HTTP and HTTPS URLs without embedded usernames or
  passwords, and malformed or unapproved schemes are ignored; and
- diagnostics remove credentials, query strings, and fragments before an
  address can reach a log message.

The trusted chrome validates every untyped command and native view bound at the
IPC boundary. Commands can address only bounded app-generated tab IDs, and URL
and persisted-data sizes are capped before use.

The dedicated authentication partition is intentionally in memory and cleared
after use. Ordinary browser storage is separate and persistent; users who need
a provider to reuse their normal system-browser profile should use **Continue
in system browser** or select the global external mode.

## Accessibility and language

Tabs expose tab roles and selected state, controls have accessible labels,
disabled navigation reflects real history state, authentication guidance uses
a status region, and page errors use an assertive alert. Browser and Settings
copy is available in English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual
mode. The find bar labels its input, mode, case, navigation, result context,
and close controls; its status is live and its layout wraps at narrow widths.
Error and security copy stays direct at every funny level.

## Verification

The combined local browser/restore/IPC/localization/private-badge run passed
**652/652 tests across 53 files**. It includes strict HTTP(S) normalization,
HTTPS promotion for bare hosts, URL redaction, bookmark bounds and
sanitization, global preference persistence, command and native-bound
validation, plus browser state/open-mode IPC coverage. The two deterministic
CDP verifier contract suites passed **14/14**, and full TypeScript checking was
clean.

The exact Windows production build completed with `returncode 0`,
`timed_out false`, `client_ok true`, and no stderr. Its `out` directory
contains the dedicated internal-browser HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets.
Running that real build on an isolated hidden Win32 desktop proved same-tab
redirects, popup capture into a new tab, the New tab control, query/fragment
removal from bookmark storage, and the authentication escape. The fixture used
no real account, credential, or provider. The accepted 1144×741 image above
passed original-resolution clipping, overlap, and private-data inspection.

The source and accepted screenshot are pushed through
`2abccae8fddcf2eb79edd18724454bb9b6530f67`; the image above renders that
immutable historical blob, not mutable `main` and not the current refresh.
Pages/wiki publication and packaged Windows E2E were verified at that dated
checkpoint. Installer/Release verification remained pending then; the archived
TUI correction is outside the supported-product gate.

The current page-search renderer slice adds focused contract and chrome coverage
of **32/32 tests**. Its exact production build and hidden-desktop smoke are
tracked in the active handoff and must be re-run after the next source commit;
the historical screenshot above does not claim find-bar runtime coverage.

## API applicability

This feature uses the Electron main process, the trusted local browser chrome,
and private renderer/main IPC. It adds no HTTP API, so a Postman collection is
not applicable.
