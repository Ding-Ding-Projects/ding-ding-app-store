# Browser-style settings tabs

Global Settings, Repository Settings, and Stash Manager use the same horizontal
browser-style tab surface. Each page has a stable identity, a visible active
state, a close action, and a new-page action that reopens pages without
discarding the page currently being edited.

## Behavior

- Settings pages are presented in one horizontal tab lane instead of a
  vertical rail or a one-off row of pills.
- The active page is linked to its `tabpanel`; inactive pages use the shared
  tab-strip keyboard behavior with `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, and `End`.
- Closing the active page selects its next surviving page and returns focus to
  that tab. Selecting a page from the overflow or new-page picker also returns
  focus to the selected tab.
- The plus action opens an anchored page picker with its own search field and
  regex-builder controls. When every page is already open, the action remains
  disabled and explains why.
- The overflow action is measured from the actual horizontal scrollport and is
  refreshed after both resize and scroll. Long labels retain their full name
  through the accessible name and the overflow-aware tooltip.
- Repository Settings keeps its complete page catalogue separate from the
  filtered display. Searching for a page never closes or forgets other open
  pages.
- Open pages are persisted per surface under the renderer's local settings
  storage. Stored IDs are treated as untrusted input: duplicates, empty IDs,
  removed pages, and stale migrations are discarded before rendering. A valid
  page after a long run of stale IDs is retained, and at least one page remains
  available.

## Configuration and persistence

The shared model in `app/src/ui/settings-tabs/settings-tab-model.ts` scopes open
pages and pins by `preferences`, `repository-settings`, and `stash-manager`.
The browser strip accepts a complete page catalogue when a caller displays a
filtered view. This prevents temporary search results from being mistaken for
the user's saved tab session.

The stash surface supplies localized action names for English, playful
Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual rendering. The tab names themselves
remain factual; funny-level styling changes surrounding copy, not page
identity.

## Failure modes and recovery

- If local storage cannot be read, the strip opens the declared pages and keeps
  navigation available.
- If local storage cannot be written, the current session still works; the
  next visit may reopen the declared pages.
- If a page disappears between releases, it is removed from the persisted
  session on the next render and the active page is kept valid.
- If a search has no matching page, the selected page remains visible so the
  user can return to a known location and clear the query.
- A disabled mutation state disables tab selection, closing, and page opening
  together so a long-running repository operation cannot be re-entered through
  the navigation chrome.

## Security and privacy

Open-page and pin state is local UI preference data. It contains only stable
page IDs, never repository credentials, remote URLs, stash contents, or
provider-authored text. Values read from storage are bounded and validated
before they are used as DOM identities or rendered labels. Picker searches run
locally and do not transmit the query or sample text.

## Verification

- The combined focused UI, style, documentation, and wiki suites pass **111
  tests, 111 passed, 0 failed**. The run includes the shared strip, Repository
  Settings search, Stash Manager, compact settings styles, responsive dialog
  styles, generated screenshot pages, the wiki gallery, and the new scoped
  pin, filtered-first-visit, disabled-context-menu, and picker-focus cases.
- Coverage includes horizontal semantics, linked panels, open/close behavior,
  focus restoration, search filtering without session loss, stale-storage
  reconciliation, malformed storage, localized Stash Manager actions, and
  compact layout contracts, repository-scoped pins, and empty-result
  combobox/listbox linkage.
- The exact production build command
  `npx --no-install cross-env RELEASE_CHANNEL=development
  DESKTOP_SKIP_PACKAGE=1 yarn build:prod` completed with exit code 0. The
  renderer, main process, shell extension, licenses, and stylesheet checks all
  completed; the analyzer's existing `import.meta` warning did not change the
  successful build result.
- TypeScript's audit now has one unchanged dependency diagnostic in
  `app/node_modules/dexie/dist/dexie.d.ts` (`TS1540`); no changed source file
  is in that baseline diagnostic.

### Runtime evidence

The real production Electron artifact was launched on the named hidden desktop
`dm-tabs-d9ad5763` with the disposable `fixture` repository. The exact window
handle was resolved from that desktop at capture time, and CDP captured the
three 1440×960 frames after the tab lanes and active panels were inspected. The
run manifest is
`.codex/verification/settings-browser-tabs-headless-run-manifest.json`.

| Surface | Evidence | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global Settings | browser-style Settings frame | `43ff361771efeeeb01eb8b40b778b9a4e5b3a311457fc632271d9ad4aa513fc` |
| Repository Settings | browser-style Repository Settings frame | `4850a060ed8ffb9c8fd06bf013e6b503b4928c58bf0449c45e56887be09ad962` |
| Stash Manager | browser-style Stash Manager frame | `52254a7b62ba0a9ce3d84c19fe3cd5e4e30a37ede79d3122afa57665b9759ca3` |

The frames are current-source UI evidence, not installer or release evidence.
The headless MCP endpoint was already saturated by an unrelated capture job, so
the sanctioned installed Cheap Version CLI was used against the same cheap
headless route; the hidden desktop and visible user's desktop remained
untouched.
