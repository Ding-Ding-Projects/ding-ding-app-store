# Automated update build status and release notes

Desktop Material distinguishes an available Windows update from a newer commit
that GitHub Actions is still packaging. Automated GitHub Releases also explain
which exact commits they contain instead of publishing only a generic build
message.

## Behavior

After Squirrel reports that no update is available, the renderer derives the
GitHub repository from the configured `releases/latest/download/` feed. It asks
GitHub for bounded provider data from both `ci-linux.yml`/`ci-windows.yml` and
`build-installers.yml`, and shows **New update coming soon** only when all of
these checks pass:

- the feed is an HTTPS `github.com/<owner>/<repository>/releases/...` URL;
- the installed build exposes an exact 40-character `__SHA__`;
- either a push-triggered CI run or a `workflow_run`/manual-dispatch installer
  run is `in_progress` on `main` under its exact expected workflow path;
- bounded job data proves that run's exact `Windows x64` build or packaging job
  is itself `in_progress` for the same run ID and head SHA;
- the run exposes a different exact `head_sha`; and
- GitHub's compare endpoint reports that build SHA as `ahead` of the installed
  SHA.

The status is in-memory remote state. It is not written to local storage. The
ordinary last-successful-check timestamp remains persisted, so restart behavior
stays compatible. English renders **New update coming soon**, playful Hong Kong
Cantonese renders **新版本就快焗好出爐**, and bilingual mode renders both in the
shared compact format.

An updater transition generation guards every asynchronous no-update probe. If
Squirrel reports a real available or downloaded release while the provider
request is still running, the real updater event wins. A subsequent manual or
four-hour periodic check uses the release feed normally and begins the existing
download flow as soon as the release is published.

Both release lanes stamp Squirrel packages through
`script/release-version.js` as
`<base>-z<9-letter-base-26-GitHub-run-ID>`. Execution attempts after the first
append `-r<2-letter-base-26-attempt>` so a rerun can publish a fresh ordered
tag without replacing the first attempt. One shared namespace matters because
the historical Super Express `s…` namespace sorted above every normal `b…`
build and could make a newer release look like a downgrade. The `z…` migration
sorts above both legacy lanes, while the fixed-width alphabetic encoding retains
numeric run-ID and attempt order under lexical comparison and cannot overflow
Squirrel's legacy integer parser. Manual version overrides are accepted only
when they pass the same generated `z` namespace validator.

## Automated release notes

`Build Installers / Express Release` checks out the exact
`RELEASE_TARGET_SHA` with full history, then runs
`script/generate-automated-release-notes.ts` before the single publish action.
The generator:

1. requires `HEAD` to equal the exact release SHA;
2. scans bounded published Release pages for the newest non-draft,
   non-prerelease installer tag that contains `RELEASES` and a full Squirrel
   package, ignoring Cheap LFS asset buckets, then resolves its tag to an exact
   commit;
3. requires that previous release commit to be an ancestor of the release
   target;
4. reads at most the newest 50 commit IDs and subjects from the exact
   `previous..target` range;
5. collapses control characters and whitespace, neutralizes Markdown, HTML,
   and mentions, and limits each subject to 180 characters;
6. caps the complete notes at 24,000 characters and records any omitted count;
   and
7. writes exact commit links and the visible exact range to a new temporary
   file consumed by `gh release create --notes-file`.

The first release has no previous tag, so it uses the exact target's reachable
history with the same limits. A mismatched checkout, tag target, ancestry,
provider response, Git object ID, or output bound stops publication.

## Express installer release

The same workflow has two deliberately different entry paths:

- A push-triggered `CI` run on the current `main` commit enters packaging
  directly. A successful CI may publish; a failed/cancelled CI may retain the
  installer artifact but can never publish a Release.
- A `workflow_dispatch` from `main` is the express recovery path. Linux lint,
  Windows x64 trampoline/unit/script tests, and the Windows x64 build/package
  job run in parallel; publication waits for all three.

The version is derived from the package version plus the workflow's unique
GitHub run ID, encoded as nine fixed-width base-26 letters in the shared `z…`
namespace. A rerun keeps the first-attempt tag but uses an ordered attempt
suffix from attempt two onward, so every execution attempt has a distinct
immutable tag and never replaces an existing Release. Immediately before
publication, the workflow proves that the tag is still absent. One create-only
`gh release create` command publishes the installer, MSI, Squirrel packages,
`RELEASES`, portable ZIP, and generated notes. It never edits or replaces an
existing Release.

Automatic Express Releases are created non-latest so the shared promotion
helper can first prove the source is still current `main`. Super Express
publishers request `Latest` after their verified assets are present. The helper
then examines the newest 100 published Windows-capable Releases — each must
carry both `RELEASES` and a full Squirrel package — and promotes the greatest valid
package version. A partial
Linux/TUI-only Release can still be published and documented, but it is never
allowed to own the Windows `Latest` feed. The helper rechecks both the same-SHA
maximum and `main` after promotion, reconciling an overlapping higher release
or demoting a newly stale candidate. Thus an older job can finish
independently without moving the update feed backward or replacing it with a
404-producing partial release.

The packaging job uploads the verified installer directory as an uncompressed,
three-day Actions artifact before release-note generation, then preserves the
notes separately. A failed CI, notes error, tag race, or GitHub Release failure
therefore leaves the exact installer payload downloadable from that workflow
run for manual recovery whenever the Windows build/package itself succeeded.

Windows jobs restore an exact-content cache of the installed root and app
`node_modules` trees plus Playwright's external FFmpeg payload. Its key includes
operating system, runner and target architecture, Node/Python versions, both
lockfiles and package manifests, install configuration, the post-install,
environment-setup, and tool-bootstrap actions, pinned Yarn, and local native-vendor
sources. A hit must contain reviewed generic, target-specific Copilot,
Electron-runtime, React JSX-runtime, `react-confetti`, and Playwright
sentinels. If a hit is incomplete, the setup action records the missing paths
and reruns the bounded dependency install automatically rather than handing the
broken cache to webpack. Legacy `installed-deps-v5` and `installed-deps-v4`
caches can warm a self-hosted Windows miss, but neither is treated as exact and
the current lockfiles still drive installation. The cross-compilation Copilot
install restores `app/package.json` and `app/yarn.lock` before the exact cache
key is computed, preventing a post-install manifest from making the saved cache
unreachable. Self-hosted keys include the runner identity and selected
Visual Studio/MSVC, ClangCL, and Windows SDK fingerprint; dependency installs
use `yarn --frozen-lockfile`. Python setup remains unconditional for native
builds. Build output, `dist`, installers, Release assets, credentials, and
runtime configuration are never cached.

The hosted Windows packaged-E2E lane launches the Squirrel installer without
PowerShell's descendant-inclusive `Start-Process -Wait`. It waits at most 300
seconds for `Setup.exe` itself and terminates that process tree on timeout. A
scoped cleanup records the pre-existing `GitHubDesktop` process IDs and the
installer session, then repeatedly stops only newly launched processes from
that session while Squirrel finishes writing the exact-version executable.
This prevents the launched application from holding the installer step open
without terminating an unrelated process that was already running.

## Workflow concurrency

Automatic Linux/Windows CI uses GitHub-hosted runners. Ordinary Windows CI
keeps an explicit `cloud` or `self-hosted` choice for a protected-main manual
dispatch; pushes, pull requests, and reusable calls cannot select the local
pool. The Windows test/package jobs in `Build Installers / Express Release` use
the fixed project-labelled self-hosted pool, while the release workflow retains
its unique run-ID/run-attempt concurrency group with
`cancel-in-progress: false`. Every eligible completion therefore keeps its own
publication opportunity. Pages publication retains the same non-cancelling
run-and-attempt contract.

Only the self-hosted Super Express release family uses ref-scoped cancellation,
so a newer emergency dispatch can release a scarce local runner from an obsolete
release. Source-contract tests enforce the approved self-hosted job inventory
and reject an unapproved local-runner declaration.
Workflows without a concurrency group, including CodeQL, remain independently
runnable.

## Super Express release

`.github/workflows/super-express-release.yml` is a separate, manual-only
emergency dispatcher. Dispatching it from `main` checks the exact commit and
tag once, then runs two inline packaging lanes in parallel. Every job in this
dispatcher is self-hosted-only: the coordinator and publisher use the
registered Linux x64 WSL runner, while the desktop package uses the registered
Windows x64 runner. If either runner is offline or busy, the run queues or
fails; it never moves to a GitHub-hosted machine.

- `.github/workflows/super-express-release-windows.yml` restores the exact
  desktop dependency cache and builds the Windows x64 production package on
  `[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]`, then publishes
  its verified artifact on that same exact Windows pool;
- `.github/workflows/super-express-release-linux-tui.yml` builds the Linux TUI
  wheel, source distribution, locked runtime constraints, bootstrap, and
  installer on `[self-hosted, Linux, X64]`.

The combined dispatcher and both packaging lanes have no cloud fallback: static
runner labels make their placement visible during workflow planning and ensure
the builds do not accidentally expose source to a different machine. The
direct Windows publisher stays on
`[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]` for artifact
download, line counting, signature-state verification, and GitHub API
operations. If that runner is offline or busy, the release queues or fails
rather than escaping to a hosted runner. It still uses the `RELEASE_TOKEN`,
`ORG_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN` authorization chain; the token never chooses a
runner.

The combined dispatcher keeps its packaging jobs inline because GitHub had
previously rejected the caller before creating any job when the runner labels
were generated dynamically. The direct Linux reusable workflow remains
packaging-only on its static self-hosted target. The Windows reusable call is
also packaging-only; only its manual dispatch path enables the self-hosted
publisher.

The Linux TUI action installs the pinned `uv` tool first and runs
`uv python install 3.12`; this avoids relying on `actions/setup-python`'s
distribution manifest, which does not list Python 3.12 for Debian 13 on the
registered WSL runner. Version discovery runs through
`uv run --python 3.12`, so the wheel, source distribution, and runtime
constraints use the same managed interpreter.

The Windows self-hosted actions run a PowerShell bootstrap before any
`shell: bash` step. Each PowerShell step uses an explicit, per-process
`-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` invocation; the machine execution policy
is not changed. The bootstrap reuses an installed `git.exe` and matching Git
Bash when they work. On a cold host it downloads pinned PortableGit `2.53.0.3`
from the canonical Git for Windows release, verifies the committed SHA-256
value, and extracts it below `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE`. It then prepends the exact Git
and Bash directories through `GITHUB_PATH`, so the deprecated Windows WSL
launcher cannot be selected accidentally.

Self-hosted Windows setup also avoids the hosted toolcache installer for the
native-module Python dependency: pinned `uv` installs Python 3.11 locally and
the action exports the interpreter returned by `uv python find 3.11` as
`npm_config_python`. GitHub-hosted and non-Windows runners retain
`actions/setup-python@v6`.

Before `actions/setup-node@v6` asks Yarn for its cache directory, the same
self-hosted Windows path runs
`bootstrap-pinned-yarn.ps1`.
That script creates a runner-temporary `yarn.cmd` shim for Windows actions and
an executable `yarn` shim for Git Bash steps; both call the repository-pinned
`vendor/yarn-1.21.1.js` through the runner's existing Node.js. It adds both the
Windows directory and its `/c/...` Git Bash form through `GITHUB_PATH`, so
`setup-node` and later `shell: bash` commands resolve the same runtime. Nothing
is installed globally, committed, or reused outside the job. This repairs a
bare registered runner where Node is present but Yarn is not, while keeping the
lockfile's declared Yarn runtime authoritative. If Node, Git Bash, or the
vendored runtime is missing, the preflight fails with the exact prerequisite
instead of letting a later step emit the less useful `yarn: command not found`
message.

The direct Windows publisher also bootstraps its release clients. It reuses or
installs checksum-verified GitHub CLI `2.97.0` and `jq` `1.7.1` beneath
versioned `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE` paths. PortableGit supplies `curl`, `sha256sum`,
and `unzip` for those canonical downloads. A cache hit skips the download; a
missing published checksum, mismatch, extraction error, or missing executable
stops publication before a tag or Release is created.

Each packaging lane also exposes its own `workflow_dispatch` action. A direct
Windows dispatch accepts an optional exact `main` SHA and Squirrel version; a
direct Linux TUI dispatch accepts an optional exact `main` SHA. Blank inputs
use the dispatched commit and derive the Windows version from the run ID plus
execution attempt. The Windows direct lane uploads its verified artifact and
publishes a standalone immutable Windows x64 Release marked `Latest` after its
verified assets are available. The Linux
direct lane remains artifact-only. The reusable `workflow_call` entry point
for the Windows lane is also artifact-only, so the combined dispatcher still
has one publisher for one complete cross-platform Release.

All Windows packages are permanently unsigned. Packaging disables certificate
auto-discovery, clears Windows signing and Azure identity inputs, and verifies
that both the setup executable and MSI report `NotSigned` before upload and
again after the direct publisher downloads the artifact. Release notes warn
that Windows may show SmartScreen or an unknown-publisher prompt. A signature
or signer invocation fails the lane; there is no credential fallback.

The Windows lane runs the repository's complete script-contract suite after
dependency setup and before it mutates the package version or starts the
production build. A stale generated catalog, unsafe release contract, or other
script failure therefore creates no release. The emergency lane still omits
unit, TUI, lint, type, parity, smoke, trampoline, and packaged E2E tests, while
the Linux TUI package lane remains packaging-only. Both lanes omit
history-generated release notes. Ordinary CI and tested Express Release remain
the comprehensive release gates.

The direct lanes still fail closed around their produced content. They require
the exact dispatched commit, use the same validated run-ID package version as
the automatic lane, reject an existing tag, and require every Windows and TUI
asset to be non-empty. The Windows direct publisher downloads its lane
artifact, writes a local note from the exact checked-out commit subject/body,
creates a uniquely tagged non-Latest Windows-only Release, writes and verifies
exact workflow timing, and only then reconciles Latest. A same-job failure
removes the captured release ID and exact new tag before restoring the previous
Latest selection. The write-capable token is present only on authenticated API
steps.
Both package and publication run on the exact
`[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]` pool. The
combined publisher downloads both lane artifacts, writes a local note from the
exact checked-out commit subject/body, and creates one
complete Release. Keeping the combined publisher as the only cross-platform
publisher preserves both the Squirrel update feed and the TUI bootstrap URL;
two independent cross-platform Releases would make the shared `latest`
redirect point at an incomplete payload. Every lane artifact remains
uncompressed for seven days. The combined dispatch `publish` checkbox defaults
on but can be cleared to build recovery artifacts without creating its
combined Release.
Published Super Express Releases use the same current-main and highest-same-SHA
promotion helper as automatic Releases.

The Super Express workflow family uses ref-scoped concurrency with
`cancel-in-progress: true`. A newer dispatch on the same ref replaces an older
self-hosted packaging run, while independent refs retain separate groups. Tags and
Releases are immutable: a same-tag race has one winner, and later attempts fail
without replacing it.

## Downgrade guard

Squirrel installs whichever entry a `RELEASES` manifest ranks highest. It never
compares that entry to the version already running, so a manifest that regresses
reads to it as an ordinary update and moves the whole install base backwards.
Two independent guards close that path.

The published manifest is bounded at its source. Both release lanes pipe
`dist/RELEASES` through `node script/release-version.js filter "$RELEASE_VERSION"`
before anything is copied into the release payload, and the package-copy loop
reads the filtered manifest rather than the raw one. Only entries naming the
`GitHubDesktop` package at exactly the version being built survive; a foreign
package, a leftover lower lane, or an unreadable line fails the release instead
of publishing a feed nobody vetted. Because the copy loop reconstructs any
package file the manifest names, filtering first also prevents a stale entry
from conjuring a mislabelled published asset.

The app checks before it hands the feed over. `app/src/lib/update-version-order.ts`
reproduces Squirrel's legacy NuGet ordering — a four-part numeric core, then the
prerelease label compared case-insensitively as one whole string, with a missing
prerelease outranking a present one — and `probeUpdateFeed` fetches the feed's
`RELEASES` and judges its highest entry against `app.getVersion()`. Only a
`downgrade` verdict is acted on: `AppWindow.checkForUpdates` then reports the
ordinary no-update state instead of calling `autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()`. An
unreachable feed, an oversized or undecodable body, a response that is not a
manifest for this package, and an unreadable running version all return
`indeterminate`, so the guard never blocks an update check it could not
actually evaluate.

Only the update feed is guarded. The release promoter also refuses to select a
published release without the `RELEASES` manifest and a full Squirrel package,
because GitHub's `releases/latest/download/` path is an asset lookup rather
than a release-directory listing. This keeps a valid older Windows feed active
when a newer release contains only the Linux/TUI payload. A Squirrel
bootstrapper invoked as
`Setup.exe --install . --checkInstall` reads its own bundled `RELEASES` from
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SquirrelTemp`, logs `First run, starting from scratch`, and
applies whatever version it carries without consulting the installed
`app-<version>` folders at all. Re-running a stale downloaded installer
therefore still replaces a newer install with the older build it contains. That
is Squirrel's installer path, outside the app and outside the feed; delete
superseded `GitHubDesktopSetup-x64.exe` downloads rather than relying on the
updater to undo them.

## Configuration

- `DESKTOP_UPDATES_URL` can replace the complete update endpoint. Coming-soon
  detection intentionally disables itself for custom or non-GitHub hosts.
- `DESKTOP_UPDATES_REPO` selects the GitHub `owner/repository` used by the
  default release feed.
- The runtime provider contract expects the active workflow files to remain
  `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-installers.yml`,
  and the three Super Express workflow files.
- The release-note step receives `GITHUB_TOKEN` through its environment. It is
  never accepted as a command-line value or written to the notes. This applies
  to the tested Express path; Super Express deliberately uses only local Git
  metadata from the checked-out commit.
- Manual express release must be dispatched from `main`. A failed CI conclusion
  permits package-only recovery but blocks publication. A wrong/stale CI
  trigger, stale dispatch SHA, existing tag, or changed default-branch tip
  stops before publication.
- Super Express Release must also be dispatched from `main`. Its Windows lane
  runs `yarn test:script` before build and publication, then deliberately omits
  unit, TUI, lint, type, parity, smoke, trampoline, packaged E2E, and
  history-note generation. Use it only when that bounded emergency path is the
  explicit operator choice. Clearing its `publish` input retains artifacts
  without creating a Release.
- Release run IDs must be positive decimal values of at most 12 digits, and
  execution attempts must be positive decimal values representable by the
  two-letter base-26 attempt suffix (at most 675). The shared generator
  converts run IDs to a nine-letter base-26 payload, rejects a stable base
  without a prerelease channel, malformed versions, and a NuGet special-version
  label over 20 characters. Manual overrides must also remain in the generated
  `z` namespace for the checked-out base version.

## Failure modes and security

Network, rate-limit, malformed-response, oversized-response, non-GitHub-feed,
invalid-SHA, non-main, wrong-workflow/event, non-running, stale, behind, and
diverged results all fail closed to the ordinary no-update state. The probe
reads at most 256 KiB per provider response and times out after ten seconds. It
never grants an update or downloads executable content; only Squirrel's
existing feed can do that.

The historical normal `b…` and Super Express `s…` version namespaces were not
cross-lane monotonic. A machine on `3.6.3-beta3-s000000000201`, for example,
correctly treated later `3.6.3-beta3-b0000040887` as older and displayed the
ordinary no-update state. The shared `z…` namespace is the migration floor for
those installations. Package generation fails rather than emitting a version
that cannot be ordered safely.

The run ID must not be embedded as one long decimal tail. The Squirrel/NuGet
comparer shipped with installed builds parses that tail as a 32-bit integer; a
current 11-digit GitHub run ID raises `OverflowException` before an update can be
selected. The letter-only base-26 payload carries the same ordering without any
numeric prerelease token. Packaged updater E2E exercises this exact path.

Commit subjects and release metadata are untrusted. The generator invokes Git
without a shell, validates tag refs and object IDs, bounds subprocess output,
neutralizes active Markdown/HTML/mention syntax, and uses create-new output-file
semantics. Release discovery reads at most twenty five-release pages and caps
each response at 8 MiB; the larger per-page byte bound accommodates the asset
metadata from full 1,000-object Cheap LFS buckets without retaining an
unbounded response. After notes generation, the workflow immediately revalidates
`origin/main` and immutable tag absence before publishing the same
`RELEASE_TARGET_SHA` as the release target.

Super Express does not call the history-aware generator. Its note comes from
`git show` against the already verified `RELEASE_TARGET_SHA`, avoiding an API
or token-dependent metadata failure while retaining the dispatched commit
subject and body.

An invalid dependency cache fails instead of silently installing into a mixed
tree. Cache misses perform the normal bounded install retries and save only
after a successful job. Release creation is intentionally non-idempotent: a
same-tag race has one winner and every later contender fails without changing
the winner. Latest promotion is a separate, source-revalidated operation; it
selects the greatest valid same-source version and never overwrites Release
assets or tags.

## Verification

The partial-Release regression guard landed in commit
`a4ce485037138f24d7534452a861a1fb7749beeb`. The focused version-order,
CI-workflow-safety, and automated-release-notes suites pass **29/29**. On
2026-08-05 the live `Latest` alias was repaired to the existing
Windows-capable Release `v3.6.3-beta3-zadwftypqg`; the exact
`releases/latest/download/RELEASES` URL returned HTTP 200 and served the
Squirrel manifest. The required Cheap headless production build ended before
renderer output was emitted, so no About-dialog screenshot is presented as
runtime evidence for this regression.

Focused acceptance covers safe feed parsing, bounded Actions data, exact
CI/installer job/run/SHA binding, ahead-of comparison, manual-dispatch and
malformed/stale fail-closed behavior, transient storage, the updater-event race,
all three language modes, non-cancelling independent CI/installer/Pages runs,
the protected Windows manual runner selector, pull-request CI, workflow wiring,
exact Git range
collection, subject sanitization, output limits, and first-release handling.
The app and script TypeScript
projects, targeted formatting/lint, workflow YAML, express-path gates,
create-only publication, retained artifacts, and exact dependency-cache keys
are also checked locally. The Super Express source contract additionally proves
manual-only triggering, exact-SHA packaging, unit/script-before-build ordering,
omitted lint/E2E/history paths, ref-scoped cancellation, retained artifacts,
self-hosted packaging and publication placement, the permanent `NotSigned`
checks, immutable tag checks, unique non-draft Latest publication, and exact
release targeting. The focused source contract enforces the exact Windows
project label on both direct jobs. Remote run `31126843395` verified the package
and
the older fallback release `v3.6.3-beta3-zadwtuvqil` verified the six published
Windows assets, but both predate the Windows-hosted publisher placement and
permanent unsigned contract. A future direct run must verify the complete
self-hosted build-and-publish path itself.
Downgrade-guard tests use the
real observed strings — `3.6.2`, `3.6.3-beta3-b0000040888`,
`3.6.3-beta3-s000000000401`, `3.6.3-beta3-zadtjbevjx`, `3.6.3-beta3-zadtofsepy`,
`3.6.3-beta3-zadtorqoxa` — and the live manifest line the feed actually served.
They prove the app comparer agrees with `script/release-version.js` across every
lane, that a `3.6.3` prerelease outranks stable `3.6.2` in both that comparer and
`semver`, that a mixed manifest is judged by the entry Squirrel would install,
that manifest filtering drops foreign packages and lower lanes while keeping the
matching delta, and that the feed probe fails open on network, HTTP, and
non-manifest responses. Release-version tests cover
the exact legacy `s…` versus `b…` failure, fixed-width alphabetic `z…` ordering,
distinct ordered rerun attempts, manual namespace validation,
malformed/overflow rejection, and out-of-order same-SHA selection.

Remote and installed acceptance is complete. Exact-source
[CI `29977738533`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29977738533)
and
[installer run `29978844761`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29978844761)
published the six-asset exact-target Release
[`v3.6.3-beta3-zadtberjmv`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/releases/tag/v3.6.3-beta3-zadtberjmv).
A live legacy `s000000000201` installation automatically selected, downloaded,
applied, and subsequently reported that alphabetic `z` version. Successful
[Super Express run `29980281736`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29980281736)
then published greater same-SHA Release
[`v3.6.3-beta3-zadtbhvdfc`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/releases/tag/v3.6.3-beta3-zadtbhvdfc),
which the legacy UI visibly downloaded and exposed as ready to install.

Current-source UI acceptance is also published as a separate frame. Runtime
source `b069384ad7d8a65d1192ee06859a705fe484c9c8` reached the ready state
through the real Electron/Squirrel event path using a disclosed verifier-owned
inert payload. Promotion `e3967f1b81ec039624500797dca40a1ab6d98598`
records the inspected 960×660, 47,086-byte PNG with SHA-256
`0fc9caf5b13eb5b914121090f403c394545e02ea4303b11dd4598afcb3a2dfca`.
This development proof does not claim that the inert payload was published.
