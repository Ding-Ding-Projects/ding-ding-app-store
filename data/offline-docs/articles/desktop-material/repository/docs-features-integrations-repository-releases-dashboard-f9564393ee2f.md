# Repository Releases dashboard

## Behavior and configuration

Open **Releases** from a GitHub repository rail to search and status-filter the
bounded loaded catalog, select a release, inspect metadata and assets, or enter
the existing reviewed create, edit, publish, delete, upload, and download
flows. The desktop catalog reserves 420–560 px for readable names, tags,
statuses, dates, selection controls, and bulk actions. It stacks below the
details pane at 900 px and remains scrollable on narrow or zoomed layouts.
Short or high-zoom panes compact the filter controls, selection summary, bulk
actions, status metrics, and rows so the release list keeps a usable minimum
height instead of disappearing below stacked controls. Metrics reflow within
the pane rather than creating a horizontal strip. The 800×560 combined short/
narrow gate covers the 768×528 CSS viewport produced by 125% zoom in a 960×660
physical window. It keeps page and panel headings at 16/14 px, interactive
labels at 11 px, metadata at 9–10 px, controls at 30–34 px, the tools panel at
176 px, and release rows at 52 px. Its native disclosure wraps instead of
shrinking English/Cantonese bilingual text, and the five metrics use three
columns with the latest value spanning two.

The surface uses the selected repository's provider account and supports fuzzy,
substring, and regular-expression matching plus published, prerelease, and
draft status filters. **Load more releases** requests the next bounded provider
page before filtering it locally.

**Load all releases** pages through every remaining release in one walk so the
search bar filters the whole repository instead of the pages that happen to be
on screen. It resumes from the page the interactive loader stopped at, appends
into the same loaded catalog the filter already reads — there is no second,
unfiltered list — and reports a live `{loaded} of ?` count next to its own
button while it runs. The walk shares the ten-page ceiling the release API
layer refuses to parse past, which bounds one repository at 300 releases. It
never truncates silently: reaching the ceiling, hitting GitHub's API rate
limit, being canceled, and failing each produce their own message naming what
stopped the walk and how many releases are loaded. A rate limit, a
cancellation, and a provider failure all keep the pages that did load and leave
the button enabled so the walk can resume from the next unread page rather than
restarting from page one.

Deleting a multi-release selection reports determinate progress: a
`role="progressbar"` meter carrying `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemax`, a
`role="status"` line counting deleted and failed against the reviewed total,
and **Stop after this release**. The stop is deliberately not the hard Cancel —
the release already sent to GitHub is allowed to finish, because reporting
destructive work as "not attempted" while it is running would be untrue. A
release the provider refuses no longer abandons the rest of the batch: its
bounded reason is listed and the remaining releases continue. The closing
summary states exactly how many were deleted, how many failed, and how many
were never attempted, and it stays on screen until a new batch is reviewed.

A **Sort** control beside the status filter orders the catalog **Newest first**
(the default, matching the previous behavior) or **Oldest first** by published
date, falling back to the created date for an unpublished draft so drafts do
not drift to one end of the list. The choice persists per list under the same
convention as the search mode. Order is applied last, over whatever survived
the status and search filters, so the two compose rather than fork — the filter
decides which releases are shown and the sort decides only their order — and
because both run over the one loaded catalog, the order covers everything an
exhaustive walk added. Ties break on release id so the order is total and does
not flicker between renders.

Release dates include a locale-aware 24-hour `HH:mm` time. After an asset has
downloaded and passed its existing size/digest checks, the result offers both
**Show in folder** and **Open file**.

When the downloaded asset is an installer, the result also offers a
**Silent install** button. The button itself is the consent: one explicit click
starts the run, and the label names the exact file it will execute. Only files
the flag table recognizes are offered at all — an archive, a `.nupkg`, or any
unrecognized asset gets no button, because a control that silently means
"execute this download" would be a trap. The table is extension-first: a `.msi`
is handed to `msiexec /i <path> /qn /norestart` (never executed directly), and
an `.exe` is identified from a bounded read of its own leading bytes — Inno
Setup takes `/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART`, NSIS and Squirrel take
`/S`. An `.exe` whose family cannot be identified is still offered, but as
**Attempt silent install**, because `/S` is a convention rather than a
guarantee.

The run itself happens in the main process over the
`silent-install-release-asset` channel, so a long unattended install never
blocks the interface that started it, and one install at a time is enforced per
downloaded file by a synchronous in-flight claim. Before anything is spawned,
the main process re-verifies that the path still exists, is a file, and matches
the release asset's size; a mismatch is refused with a plain reason and nothing
runs. The launch is deliberately unprivileged — no shell, no `runas`, no other
elevation path — so a Windows elevation prompt that blocks the installer is
reported as an ordinary failure with its exit code rather than worked around. A
persistent notice reports start, indeterminate progress with elapsed seconds
while it runs, and then the real exit code plus a sanitized, bounded tail of
the installer's own output. Open-file completion and failure callbacks
are generation-fenced, so a late Windows response cannot update a disposed or
newly selected release. Clearing a filtered selection moves keyboard focus to
an enabled Select all or search fallback even when the filter has zero results.

## Failure modes

Initial loading, asset loading, empty repository, empty filter result, invalid
regular expression, and provider failure remain distinct states. A retry keeps
already loaded data and repeats only the failed scope. Destructive or
publishing controls stay disabled until their exact reviewed selection is
valid.

The exhaustive walk distinguishes completion, the page ceiling, the API rate
limit, cancellation, and a provider failure, and never reports a partial list
as the whole repository. A rate-limited or failed walk reports its notice
without offering the page-one retry, which would discard everything it loaded.
Bulk deletion distinguishes a clean batch, a batch with per-release failures, a
stop between releases, and a hard cancel; a result arriving after the batch
closed is ignored so an out-of-order response cannot resurrect the run or push
the counters past the reviewed total. Only one Releases operation runs at a
time: the operation slot is claimed synchronously before the first `await`, so
a stuttered double-click on either control cannot start the work twice.

## Security considerations

Repository, account, and provider host remain bound through every request.
Remote URLs are validated before opening, response and pagination sizes stay
bounded, and asset transfers retain their existing path, size, digest, and
overwrite checks. This feature adds no application HTTP endpoint, so a new
Postman artifact is not applicable.

Unattended installation executes a file, so its limits are deliberate. Only an
explicit click starts it, and only for an asset the flag table recognizes as an
installer. The exact downloaded path is re-verified (exists, is a file, matches
the release asset's size) inside the main process immediately before launch, so
a replaced or resized file is refused rather than run. The child is spawned
without a shell — the path and switches are passed as argv, so a file name
containing shell syntax cannot become part of a command line — and without any
elevation path, so the installer runs at exactly the app's own privilege. The
installer's output is treated as untrusted text: control characters are
flattened and the retained tail is bounded before it is shown.

## Verification

`github-releases-style-test.ts` covers the catalog, compact control and metric
reflow, explicit readable size floors, bilingual wrapping, low-height list
space, Material tokens, containment, focus, and narrow fallback. Provider
behavior, localized compact controls, 24-hour timestamps, guarded Open file
lifecycle, and zero-result focus recovery remain in the GitHub Releases unit
suites. `github-release-bulk-delete-test.ts` covers the deletion progress
reducer: clean completion, per-release failures that do not abandon the batch,
the exact split after a stop, ignored out-of-order results, clamped and
control-character-flattened provider reasons, and the bounded failure list.
`github-releases-store-test.ts` covers the exhaustive walk — resuming from a
page, reporting each page, refusing to read past the absolute ceiling, keeping
what loaded on cancellation and on the API rate limit, and still failing loudly
by default for the Cheap LFS inventory review. The view suite proves the search
filter recomputes over the fully loaded set and that bulk deletion renders its
progressbar, stop, and partial-failure summary. `silent-install-test.ts` covers
the flag table (msiexec routing, each identified exe family, the honest
uncertain fallback, and the assets that get no button at all), the pre-launch
verification decision, the bounded output sanitizer, and the per-file in-flight
guard; `ipc-contract-test.ts` pins the new channel. `github-release-sort-test.ts`
covers the order, the draft date fallback, the stable tie-break, and its
composition with the search filter. The corrected production bundle
completed in 390 seconds wall (Yarn
387.64 seconds). Its 1,179,200-byte `out/renderer.css` has SHA-256
`6fba1434112ea5c02256a12e6ce8af42f5c870f0db5835155acb8075708d9d28`.
Off-screen Win32 acceptance kept one 960×660 physical viewport while probing
100%, 125%, 150%, and 200%. Every scale retained a complete release row with
zero document/body/root/panel horizontal overflow. Compact scales proved the
176 px panel, 52 px row, 30 px target, 9 px text, three-column/latest-span-two,
24-hour timestamp, and disclosure keyboard contracts. The promoted 89,856-byte
PNG has SHA-256
`8e29ac666a0832d353126d8dd759200ba7e853016a940501e5c7cbdbb1cf992a`.
This is the accepted isolated correction receipt; remote publication remains a
separate gate.
