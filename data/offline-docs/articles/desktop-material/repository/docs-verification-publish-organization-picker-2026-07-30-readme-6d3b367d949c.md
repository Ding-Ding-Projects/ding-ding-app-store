# Publish organization picker sizing acceptance — 2026-07-30

This receipt covers the **Publish repository → Organization** listbox repair.
It does not claim that a repository was published: the acceptance fixture has
no remote, uses a synthetic loopback provider, and stops at the reviewed
dialog.

## Accepted behavior

- The ownership surface is a real searchable `role="listbox"`, with an
  explicit personal-account **None** option and three synthetic organization
  options.
- Its search uses the audited fuzzy, substring, and safe-regex modes plus the
  shared Regex Builder.
- Invalid regex leaves every destination reachable and reports inline
  feedback.
- Keyboard movement, selection, active-descendant semantics, visible focus,
  and defensive scrolling remain operable.
- At 390×844 in bilingual mode, the listbox retains usable nonzero height,
  long organization names remain inside the dialog, the controls wrap without
  horizontal overflow, and its four fixture destinations create a real
  positive inner-scroll range whose final option is reachable.
- The restored 1440×960 frame preserves the same list geometry without
  stretching it into an unbounded page.

## Evidence boundary

The application was built from the exact repository source through the
project's production command and launched on a uniquely named off-screen
Win32 desktop through Lowlevel MCP. The run used an isolated user-data
directory and a disposable Git fixture below the run root. No visible desktop,
personal account, credential, user repository, or third-party network data was
used.

The accepted screenshot is published as
`material-publish-organization-picker.png`
after original-resolution inspection. The byte-identical retained frame is
`publish-organization-picker-1440x960.png`,
and the machine-readable measurements are in
`runtime-receipt.json`.

## Verification record



| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime source | Exact task application tree published by `63c1ec08c4f24f85d87f21d98851dcd5784c7800` (based on `dcf985d8521177406782816894c831e49e81e8c7`) |
| Focused picker, parent, registry, style, responsive, and nested-dialog keyboard tests | **26/26 passed** |
| TypeScript | `yarn tsc --noEmit` passed |
| Changed-file lint/format | Repository-rule ESLint, Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed |
| Verifier contracts | **83/83 passed** before gallery promotion; the final promoted count is re-run before commit |
| Synthetic provider | **19/19 passed** |
| Exact production build | **Passed** in 1,042.19 s; return code 0, no timeout; stderr contained only npm's upgrade notice |
| 390×844 bilingual geometry | **Passed** at physical 390×844 / logical 780×1,688 with DPR and auto-fit zoom 0.5 |
| Narrow listbox | 176 CSS px / 88 physical px high; 172 px client height, 184 px scroll height, 12 px positive range; bottom and final row reached |
| Narrow containment | Dialog contained; four options; **None** selected; long login ellipsized; no horizontal overflow |
| 1440×960 restored geometry | **Passed** at DPR/zoom 1; 176 px listbox; four options; no horizontal overflow; zoom HUD absent |
| Accepted PNG | 1,440×960; 133,919 bytes; SHA-256 `7db03d5db789d19e1ad49de66bd79abb62e46c7909eda9de08878aac367033d8` |
| Original-resolution visual/privacy inspection | **Passed**; the frame contains only synthetic fixture data and no transient zoom HUD |
| Provider safety | Scene required one organization GET delta and zero state-changing delta after its Git-read baseline |
| Owned desktop/process/path cleanup | **Passed**; app, provider, launcher, dummy credential, listener ports, windows, and owned Temp root were all verified absent |
| Exact commit / remote CI / installer Release | Implementation commit `63c1ec08c4f24f85d87f21d98851dcd5784c7800` is proven on `origin/main`; the first matrix found this retained receipt and the regenerated parity input missing, so final hosted CI and installer Release remain pending |



The scene also exercised a physical Escape through the portalled
Regex Builder. The builder dismissed exactly once while the Publish dialog
remained open, then the run continued through End,
Enter, Home, and another Enter. Invalid regex
was non-destructive, and the final provider-mutation delta remained zero.

Original-resolution review rejected an earlier formally successful candidate
because the transient 100% zoom indicator covered the search controls. The
accepted replacement waits fail closed for `#window-zoom-info` to disappear.

香港粵語：今次真係捉到「個清單喺度，但驗收尺自己量錯單位」同「100% 提示走出嚟
攝鏡」兩隻妖怪。最後收貨嗰張係真 production build、假資料、hidden desktop，
仲有 exact hash 同完整清理證明；唔再靠氣勢當測試，清單終於唔使玩密室逃脫。
