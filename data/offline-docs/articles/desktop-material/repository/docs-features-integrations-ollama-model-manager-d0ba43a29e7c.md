# Ollama model manager

Desktop Material manages an Ollama provider without exposing the native API as a
free-form request editor. There are two ways in.

**Settings → Ollama** is the standalone tab and the primary route. It renders
the lifecycle workspace directly and never depends on Copilot access or a
Copilot licence, so it is reachable while signed out. The command palette
entries **Ollama model manager** and **Ollama chat** open this tab, as do the
settings-search results for Ollama.

**Settings → Copilot → Providers** remains available for users who manage Ollama
alongside their other Copilot model providers. Add the **Ollama (local)**
provider preset, save it, and choose **Manage models** on that provider to open
the same lifecycle workspace.

## Setup state

When no Ollama provider is configured yet, the standalone tab shows a setup
state rather than any Copilot content. It offers an endpoint field prefilled
with `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, a **Connect** action, and short guidance on
installing and starting Ollama.

Connecting validates the endpoint with the same loopback rules the client
enforces, canonicalizes it to its origin, and probes `/api/version` before
anything is saved. Only after that probe succeeds is a managed provider
persisted (`type: openai`, `authKind: none`, `integration: ollama`, base URL
`<origin>/v1`) — identical to a provider created through the Copilot provider
dialog, so both routes manage the same record.

The **Connect** button stays enabled for an invalid endpoint on purpose:
activating it explains the problem in an alert that is associated with the
endpoint field through `aria-describedby`, which a disabled control could not
announce. A non-loopback host is rejected before any network request is made.
A failed probe or a failed save reports the specific reason and leaves the tab
unconfigured rather than appearing connected.

When more than one Ollama provider exists, a labelled picker selects which one
the tab manages; it is hidden for the common single-endpoint case.

The provider's configured URL serves two related purposes. Copilot requests use
Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, while the manager derives its fixed native
routes from the same trusted origin. The saved provider URL must be an exact
loopback `/v1` base; remote hosts, arbitrary path prefixes, and a saved `/api`
base are rejected. The manager derives the loopback origin and appends only its
fixed native `/api/*` routes. The default preset is
`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`; no API key is required.

## Inventory and inspection

The manager reports endpoint health and version, then loads installed and
currently running models independently. A partial response keeps usable data
visible and identifies the unavailable scope instead of clearing the whole
workspace.

- Search the installed inventory or filter it to running models. A visible
  **Clear search** action appears as soon as a query is present, clearing the
  query without changing the selected filter mode or case-sensitivity setting.
- Select a model to inspect its size, digest, modification time, format,
  family, parameter and quantization metadata, capabilities, bounded license
  text, and current runtime allocation when Ollama reports those fields.
- Refresh health, installed inventory, running state, and selected-model
  details without reopening Preferences.

Ollama may omit metadata or report it differently across model families. The
manager labels missing values rather than manufacturing them, bounds displayed
text, and treats installed and running inventories as separate sources of
truth.

## Model lifecycle

- **Pull** accepts an Ollama model name, streams bounded progress, and can be
  cancelled without blocking the rest of Preferences.
- **Copy** creates another local model name. **Rename** is a guarded copy then
  delete; if the copy succeeds but removal fails, both models remain visible
  and the manager reports the partial result.
- **Load** starts a model with Ollama's generate/keep-alive lifecycle, while
  **Unload** requests an immediate stop.
- **Delete** names the exact model and requires inline confirmation. The
  destructive request is never inferred from selection alone.

After a successful inventory-changing operation, the installed Ollama
inventory is synchronized back to that provider's selectable Copilot model
list. The refreshed inventory is authoritative: stale configured entries are
removed, new installed names are added, and existing per-model reasoning
settings are retained where identifiers still match. If Ollama succeeds but
provider persistence fails, the manager reports that split outcome instead of
claiming a complete operation.

## Versioned multi-chat workspace

Expanding **Chat** opens a provider-scoped workspace instead of one volatile
transcript. A chat can be created, selected, renamed, or deleted independently,
and changing that chat's model keeps its existing transcript intact. Deletion
names the conversation, requires inline confirmation, and removes only that
conversation and its local history.

Each chat owns a separate local Git repository below the app's user-data
directory. The provider identity and endpoint are hashed before they become a
directory name; every conversation then uses a generated UUID. User messages
are committed before a network request starts, completed assistant messages are
committed after the stream finishes, and stopping a response commits any
partial text already received. Appearance, font, model, and title changes are
versioned in the same conversation repository. The shared history viewer can
undo, redo, or restore a selected point by adding an audit commit; it never
resets or rewrites an earlier successful commit.

The workspace also provides:

- message copy, multiline text paste, image paste, and an explicit image
  picker;
- up to four PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP images per message, with per-image,
  aggregate-message, transcript, and on-disk snapshot limits;
- media-type and file-signature checks before an image is encoded, persisted,
  previewed, or sent to Ollama; and
- per-chat curated accent/surface choices plus independently persisted message
  and composer font settings.

Attached images use Ollama's native chat `images` field. The workspace validates
the payload boundary, but the selected model still needs vision support;
Ollama can reject an otherwise valid image request when that model does not
accept images. A failed or cancelled request does not discard the already
committed user prompt. A corrupt or oversized session is ignored during
discovery and cannot escape its provider-owned directory; Git or filesystem
failures surface as a bounded workspace error instead of silently falling back
to unversioned memory.

## Endpoint, privacy, and recovery boundaries

Only HTTP or HTTPS loopback URLs such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]`
are accepted. The saved path must be exactly `/v1`; every remote host,
arbitrary prefix, embedded credential, query string, fragment, or saved `/api`
base is rejected. The manager derives only that loopback origin and appends
fixed native `/api/*` routes, and operation errors are bounded before display.
Provider tokens are not required for Ollama and are never added to management
URLs, process arguments, logs, or repository files.

Chat transcripts, image bytes, appearance, and font settings stay in the local
provider-scoped repositories. They leave the machine only when the user sends a
chat request to the configured loopback Ollama endpoint. The workspace stores
no provider URL, credential, arbitrary file path, or rendered data URL inside a
conversation document.

Loading, empty, unavailable, partial, cancellation, validation, and operation
failure states remain distinct. Refreshing or changing providers aborts stale
requests, pull cancellation owns only the active pull, and one model operation
cannot silently target another model.

All visible labels, status announcements, validation messages, confirmations,
and accessible names follow the app's **English**, playful **Hong Kong
Cantonese**, or **English / 香港粵語** language mode. The workspace is keyboard
reachable, announces changing progress and results, and reflows at compact
window sizes.

## Ollama API references

The manager uses Ollama's documented native API contracts for
[installed models](https://docs.ollama.com/api/tags),
[running models](https://docs.ollama.com/api/ps),
[model details](https://docs.ollama.com/api-reference/show-model-details),
[pull](https://docs.ollama.com/api/pull),
[copy](https://docs.ollama.com/api/copy),
[delete](https://docs.ollama.com/api/delete), and
[version](https://docs.ollama.com/api-reference/get-version). Pull progress uses
Ollama's [streaming NDJSON](https://docs.ollama.com/api/streaming) response
format. Loading and unloading use the documented
[generate](https://docs.ollama.com/api/generate) keep-alive behavior; model
creation and registry publishing are outside this manager's scope.

## Verification

Acceptance covers endpoint validation and normalization, bounded response
parsing, health/version and partial inventory behavior, streamed pull progress
and cancellation, copy/rename partial results, load/unload, confirmed deletion,
provider-model synchronization, stale-request suppression, language modes,
keyboard/accessibility semantics, responsive styling, and a deterministic
loopback Ollama fixture.

Focused chat acceptance additionally covers independent repository discovery,
message/image/appearance/font commits, non-rewriting undo/redo/restore,
malformed-image rejection, bounded native chat serialization, streamed UI
updates, cancellation, model changes without transcript loss, localized
history controls, and compact workspace styling.

Standalone-tab acceptance covers the unconfigured setup state rendering without
any Copilot sign-in content, a non-Ollama BYOK provider still counting as
unconfigured, loopback rejection before any network request, endpoint
canonicalization from a `/v1` base, the exact persisted provider record, alert
association with the endpoint field, probe and save failures leaving the tab
unconfigured, the manager rendering directly for a configured provider, and the
multi-provider picker. See `app/test/unit/ui/ollama-preferences-test.tsx`; the
tab's own copy is pinned in both catalogs by
`app/test/unit/ollama-manager-i18n-test.ts`.

Exact source `27ffc1af7dd1223809c69ea0f72ddab369869f31` completed the
required low-level-MCP production build in 213.16 seconds. The deterministic
lifecycle exercise covered health, inventory, search, running state, pull
cancellation with rollback, completed pull, copy, rename, load, unload,
confirmed delete, and provider synchronization. Its accepted synthetic-only
capture is 1452×1001, 128,903 bytes, and SHA-256
`f1735c664248cd1b10a64e672dbbab24c95dabab99a62deeaf93557145a36509`.
The manager, Preferences shell, and controls remain contained above the footer
with zero overlaps and no horizontal overflow; privacy inspection passed and
owned runtime cleanup completed. Final exact-`main` Windows CI, Pages, and wiki
publication checks are intentionally recorded later in `HANDOFF.md`.
