# Command palette coverage

## Status

The shipped catalog currently contains **268 unique commands**. The R5
command-palette expansion (see below) added 21 of those: tab management
(close/close-others/close-to-left/close-to-right, favorite, rename, move to
group, group collapse, group delete, and all eight sort orders), settings
undo/redo, and dot-com/Enterprise sign-in — every one wired to the app's
existing dispatcher and store methods rather than new business logic. Of the
133 surveyed commands, 131 are in the palette; 49 of them carry a live
control the reader can change from the row itself; the rest teleport to the
setting, which for a destination is the whole of what a row can do.

Nothing in the catalog is inert: every row either goes somewhere, changes a
value in place, or runs a handler, and a test fails the build if one does not.

## The original survey

**Sources read:** `app/src/lib/command-palette-catalog.ts` (247 entries; 246 Windows-eligible before availability predicates), `app/src/lib/teleport-targets.ts` (31 target keys), `app/src/models/preferences.ts` (14 `PreferencesTab` members), `app/src/ui/repository-settings/repository-settings.tsx` (11 `RepositorySettingsTab` members), `app/src/main-process/menu/menu-event.ts` (69 `MenuEvent` members) + `build-default-menu.ts`, `app/src/ui/app.tsx` (`onPaletteCommand`, `getPaletteControlValues`, `onPaletteControlChange`), `app/test/unit/command-palette-catalog-test.ts`, `app/src/ui/preferences/prompts.tsx`, `app/src/lib/audio/audio-settings.ts`.

**Result: 133 gap entries (G1–G133).** Every one is stated as event id / title / group / control kind / teleport target. Teleport targets follow the file's real convention: a camelCase key in `TeleportTargetSelectors` whose value is `[data-teleport-target="<kebab-id>"]`, with the owning element spreading `teleportAnchor('<kebab-id>')`.

---

## PART 0 — Read this before implementing: five type-level blockers

These are not opinions; they are places where the current types cannot express the gap, so the entry must either change the types or degrade to a navigator row.

| # | Blocker | Affects | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1** | `IPaletteChoiceControl.options` is a static array of `{ value, labelKey: TranslationKey }`. Runtime-discovered lists have no translation key and no fixed length. | G16–G18 (date/time/number formats), G45–G46 (editors, shells), G42 (hook shells is fixed — OK), G77–G78 (Copilot models), G97 (fixed — OK), G132 (accounts) | Add a fifth control kind `{ kind: 'dynamic-choice', optionsId: string }` resolved in `app.tsx` beside `getPaletteControlValues()`. Without it, G16–G18/G45/G46/G77/G78/G132 must ship as **navigator rows with no `control`**. |
| **T2** | `IPaletteCommandContext` has only `platform, repositoryKey, hasRepository, hasRemote, hasBranch, isGitHubRepository`. | G89 (fork settings), G85 (submodules), G105 (Cheap LFS encryption), G75 (repo music) | Add `isFork`, `hasSubmodules`, `isCheapLfsRepository` and matching predicates `whenFork`, `whenSubmodules`. Until then those rows must be unconditioned and will teleport to an absent tab. |
| **T3** | `platform` is `'darwin' \| 'win32'` — there is no `'linux'`. | G7 ("Show logs in your File Manager" differs on Linux) | Widen to `'darwin' \| 'win32' \| 'linux'`, or accept a shared label. |
| **T4** | `IPaletteNumberControl` has no unit/suffix. Volumes (0–100), scale (%), cooldown (s), hours (0–23) will render as bare integers. | G11, G64, G67, G68, G70, G72, G73 | Add `readonly unitKey?: TranslationKey` to `IPaletteNumberControl`. |
| **T5** | `IPaletteHome` has only `'surface'` and `'preferences'`. Repository settings is a different popup with its own tab enum. | G82–G105 | Either add `IPaletteRepositorySettingsHome { kind: 'repositorySettings'; tab: RepositorySettingsTab; targetId? }`, **or** (cheaper, matches what `palette:cheap-lfs-settings` already does) use `kind: 'surface'` with `openEvent` pointing at the sibling tab-navigator command. Every G82–G105 row below is written for the cheaper option. |

**New `labelKey` values needed for `IPaletteSurfaceHome`** (only 7 exist today — `homeDialog`, `homeToolbar`, `homeSidebar`, `homeChangesView`, `homeCommitBox`, `homeRepositoryList`, `homeSettings`):

```
'commandPalette.homeRepositorySettings'  → "Repository settings › {tab}"
'commandPalette.homeRepositoryTools'     → "Repository tools"
'commandPalette.homeTabStrip'            → "Tab strip"
'commandPalette.homeTitleBar'            → "Title bar"
'commandPalette.homeDiffOptions'         → "Diff options"
'commandPalette.homeCommandPalette'      → "This palette"
'commandPalette.homeMenuBar'             → "Menu bar"
```

Each needs a Cantonese value too, and every `palette:` event below needs its `titleKey` added to the `TranslationKey` union (~line 1855), the English map (~5204), the Cantonese map (~8737), plus its event appended to `NewCommandEvents` (test line 47) with non-empty `keywords`.

---

## PART A — Menu commands not in the catalog (9 gaps)

### A1. Real `MenuEvent`s missing from the catalog

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | `increase-active-resizable-width` | Expand the active resizable pane | `App` | none | `home: { kind: 'surface', labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeSidebar', targetId: 'repositorySidebar' }` — **no `openEvent`**: teleport must show the pane edge, not resize it |
| **G2** | `decrease-active-resizable-width` | Contract the active resizable pane | `App` | none | same as G1 |

`find-text` (Edit ▸ Command palette, `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+F`) is **not a gap** — the menu opener dispatches the master palette, while `palette:find-in-view` dispatches `this.findText()` in `onPaletteCommand` and carries `find` in its keywords.

The notification routes are intentionally separate: `palette:notification-centre`
opens the live notification centre, while `palette:notification-history` opens
the local Git-backed history dialog. The menu shortcut is the same
`CmdOrCtrl+Shift+F` contract on every supported desktop platform.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Before the route fix, the notification search returned one misleading Open notification centre row.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: After the route fix, the notification search exposes separate centre and history commands.*

Selecting the centre row was also exercised against the built artifact; it
opened the live local/GitHub notification centre without leaving the palette
route behind.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: The corrected command-palette route opens the live notification centre side sheet.*

### A2. Menu items whose click handler is main-process-only (no `MenuEvent` exists)

These need a new `palette:` id, a `case` in `onPaletteCommand`, **and** a new IPC/renderer path, because they are `openWebLink`/`UNSAFE_openDirectory` calls living in `build-default-menu.ts` lines 616–672.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G3** | `palette:report-issue` | Report an issue | `App` | none | `home: { kind: 'surface', labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeMenuBar' }` — no `targetId`; the Electron menu bar is not a DOM element |
| **G4** | `palette:contact-support` | Contact GitHub support | `App` | none | same as G3 |
| **G5** | `palette:user-guides` | Show the user guides | `App` | none | same as G3 |
| **G6** | `palette:keyboard-shortcuts` | Show keyboard shortcuts | `App` | none | same as G3 |
| **G7** | `palette:show-logs-folder` | Show the logs folder | `App` | none | same as G3. Companion to the existing `view-log-history`; label varies per OS (see **T3**) |
| **G8** | `palette:toggle-devtools` | Toggle developer tools | `App` | none | same as G3 |
| **G9** | `palette:reload-window` | Reload the window | `App` | none | same as G3. **Flag:** the menu item is `visible: __RELEASE_CHANNEL__ === 'development'` and reloading destroys the palette mid-dispatch. Ship it only behind the same dev gate, or omit. |

---

## PART B — Settings not in the catalog (124 gaps)

Already covered by the 19 existing control rows: dark theme, language mode, both playfulness sliders, diff tab size, highlight features, 4 confirmations, notifications enabled, underline links, credential helper, Windows OpenSSH, side-by-side diff, hide whitespace, commit summary, clone URL.

### B1 · Preferences ▸ Appearance — `PreferencesTab.Appearance` (10)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target (new key → selector) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G10** | `palette:set-theme-mode` | Theme | `App` | `choice` `light` / `dark` / `system` | **existing** `settingsTheme`. **This is a real gap, not a duplicate:** `palette:toggle-theme` is a 2-state switch, so **System theme is unreachable from the palette**. Keep both, or replace the toggle. `system` option must be hidden when `supportsSystemThemeChanges()` is false. |
| **G11** | `palette:set-ui-scale` | Interface scale | `App` | `number` min 50 max 200 step 5 (see T4) | `settingsUiScale` → `[data-teleport-target="settings-ui-scale"]` on the Scale slider in `appearance.tsx` |
| **G12** | `palette:set-auto-fit-zoom` | Shrink the interface to fit small windows | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsAutoFitZoom` → `settings-auto-fit-zoom` |
| **G13** | `palette:set-show-recent-repositories` | Show recent repositories | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsShowRecentRepositories` → `settings-show-recent-repositories` |
| **G14** | `palette:set-branch-name-in-repo-list` | Show the branch name in the repository list | `App` | `choice` `always` / `notDefault` / `never` (`ShowBranchNameInRepoListSetting`) | `settingsBranchNameInRepoList` → `settings-branch-name-in-repo-list` |
| **G15** | `palette:set-branch-sort` | Sort branches | `Branch` | `choice` `lastModified` / `alphabetical` | `settingsBranchSort` → `settings-branch-sort` |
| **G16** | `palette:set-date-format` | Date format | `App` | `choice` from `dateFormats` — **blocked by T1** | `settingsDateFormat` → `settings-date-format`. Gated on `enableFormattingPreferences()` |
| **G17** | `palette:set-time-format` | Time format | `App` | `choice` from `timeFormats` — **T1** | `settingsTimeFormat` → `settings-time-format` |
| **G18** | `palette:set-number-format` | Number format | `App` | `choice` from `numberFormats` — **T1** | `settingsNumberFormat` → `settings-number-format` |
| **G19** | `palette:set-prefer-absolute-dates` | Prefer absolute dates over relative | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsPreferAbsoluteDates` → `settings-prefer-absolute-dates` |

### B2 · Preferences ▸ Advanced — `PreferencesTab.Advanced` (7)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G20** | `palette:set-auto-switch-account` | Switch the active account to the repository owner | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsAutoSwitchAccount` → `settings-auto-switch-account` |
| **G21** | `palette:set-repository-indicators` | Show status icons in the repository list | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsRepositoryIndicators` → `settings-repository-indicators` |
| **G22** | `palette:set-usage-stats` | Submit usage stats | `App` | `toggle` (**value is inverted** — the stored preference is `optOutOfUsageTracking`) | `settingsUsageStats` → `settings-usage-stats`. Whole section renders only when `ENABLE_TELEMETRY`; row must be omitted otherwise |
| **G23** | `palette:set-verbose-logging` | Verbose logging (debug level) | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsVerboseLogging` → `settings-verbose-logging` |
| **G24** | `palette:set-large-repo-auto-detect` | Detect large repositories automatically | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsLargeRepoAutoDetect` → `settings-large-repo-auto-detect` |
| **G25** | `palette:set-large-repo-auto-repack` | Repack large repositories when idle | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsLargeRepoAutoRepack` → `settings-large-repo-auto-repack` |
| **G26** | `palette:set-browser-open-mode` | Open web links | `App` | `choice` `internal` / `external` | `settingsBrowserOpenMode` → `settings-browser-open-mode` |

### B3 · Preferences ▸ Prompts — `PreferencesTab.Prompts` (8)

Verified against `prompts.tsx`: the tab has exactly 10 confirmation checkboxes + 1 radio group + the commit-length toggle. Four checkboxes and the commit-length toggle are already catalogued; the other **seven checkboxes and the radio group are missing**.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G27** | `palette:set-confirm-discard-permanently` | Confirm before permanently discarding changes | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsConfirmDiscardPermanently` → `settings-confirm-discard-permanently` |
| **G28** | `palette:set-confirm-discard-stash` | Confirm before discarding a stash | `Changes` | `toggle` (`confirmDiscardStash` / state `askForConfirmationOnDiscardStash`) | `settingsConfirmDiscardStash` → `settings-confirm-discard-stash` |
| **G29** | `palette:set-confirm-checkout-commit` | Confirm before checking out a commit | `Branch` | `toggle` (`confirmCheckoutCommit`) | `settingsConfirmCheckoutCommit` → `settings-confirm-checkout-commit` |
| **G30** | `palette:set-confirm-undo-commit` | Confirm before undoing a commit | `Changes` | `toggle` | `settingsConfirmUndoCommit` → `settings-confirm-undo-commit` |
| **G31** | `palette:set-confirm-commit-message-override` | Confirm before overwriting the commit message with a generated one | `Changes` | `toggle` | `settingsConfirmCommitMessageOverride` → `settings-confirm-commit-message-override` |
| **G32** | `palette:set-confirm-worktree-removal` | Confirm before removing a worktree | `Branch` | `toggle` | `settingsConfirmWorktreeRemoval` → `settings-confirm-worktree-removal` |
| **G33** | `palette:set-confirm-commit-filtered-changes` | Confirm before committing changes hidden by the filter | `Changes` | `toggle` (`askForConfirmationOnCommitFilteredChanges`) | `settingsConfirmCommitFilteredChanges` → `settings-confirm-commit-filtered-changes` |
| **G34** | `palette:set-uncommitted-changes-strategy` | When switching branches with uncommitted changes | `Changes` | `choice` `askForConfirmation` / `moveToNewBranch` / `stashOnCurrentBranch` | `settingsUncommittedChangesStrategy` → `settings-uncommitted-changes-strategy` |

> The identical **"Do not show this message again"** checkbox appearing in 11 dialog files (`discard-changes-dialog.tsx`, `confirm-force-push.tsx`, `confirm-checkout-commit.tsx`, `delete-worktree-dialog.tsx`, `confirm-discard-stash.tsx`, `warn-local-changes-before-undo.tsx`, `confirm-commit-filtered-changes-dialog.tsx`, `generate-commit-message-override-warning.tsx`, `discard-selection-dialog.tsx`, `discard-changes-retry-dialog.tsx`, `warn-force-push-dialog.tsx`, `move-to-applications-folder.tsx`) writes **the same preferences as G27–G33 and the existing four**. Do **not** create catalog rows for them.

### B4 · Preferences ▸ Accessibility & Notifications (2)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G35** | `palette:set-diff-check-marks` | Show check marks in the diff | `Changes` | `toggle` | `settingsDiffCheckMarks` → `settings-diff-check-marks`, `tab: PreferencesTab.Accessibility` |
| **G36** | `palette:set-error-presentation` | Application error presentation | `App` | `choice` `notice` / `dialog` (`ErrorPresentationStyle`) | `settingsErrorPresentation` → `settings-error-presentation`, `tab: PreferencesTab.Notifications` |

### B5 · Preferences ▸ Git — `PreferencesTab.Git` (8)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G37** | `palette:entry-git-author-name` | Git author name | `App` | `entry` `maxLength: 255`, `clearOnApply: false` | `settingsGitAuthorName` → `settings-git-author-name`. **Flag:** the Save button is disabled on `disallowedCharactersMessage`; the palette must run the same validation and refuse rather than write an invalid `user.name` |
| **G38** | `palette:entry-git-author-email` | Git author email | `App` | `entry` `maxLength: 320` | `settingsGitAuthorEmail` → `settings-git-author-email`. The UI is a select-of-account-emails **plus** free text — the palette entry writes the free-text path |
| **G39** | `palette:set-show-commit-identity` | Show the effective identity above the commit message | `Changes` | `toggle` | `settingsShowCommitIdentity` → `settings-show-commit-identity` |
| **G40** | `palette:entry-default-branch-name` | Default branch name for new repositories | `Branch` | `entry` `maxLength: 255` | `settingsDefaultBranchName` → `settings-default-branch-name`. Must reuse `RefNameTextBox` validation |
| **G41** | `palette:set-git-hook-env` | Load Git hook environment variables from the shell | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsGitHookEnv` → `settings-git-hook-env` |
| **G42** | `palette:set-git-hook-env-shell` | Shell used to load the hook environment | `App` | `choice` `git-bash` / `pwsh` / `powershell` / `cmd` (fixed list — **not** blocked by T1) | `settingsGitHookEnvShell` → `settings-git-hook-env-shell`, `platform: 'win32'`, only when `enableGitHookEnv` |
| **G43** | `palette:set-git-hook-env-cache` | Cache Git hook environment variables | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsGitHookEnvCache` → `settings-git-hook-env-cache` |
| **G44** | `palette:global-ignore` | Global ignore rules | `App` | **none** (navigator — a path field + free textarea + 4 buttons cannot be one row) | `settingsGlobalIgnore` → `settings-global-ignore` |

### B6 · Preferences ▸ Integrations — `PreferencesTab.Integrations` (7)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G45** | `palette:set-external-editor` | External editor | `App` | `dynamic-choice` — **blocked by T1**; ship as navigator until T1 lands | **existing** `settingsExternalEditor` |
| **G46** | `palette:set-shell` | Shell | `App` | `dynamic-choice` — **T1** | **existing** `settingsShell` |
| **G47** | `palette:set-context-menu-opencode` | Explorer context menu: Open with OpenCode here | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsContextMenuOpencode` → `settings-context-menu-opencode`, `platform: 'win32'`. **Flag:** writes the Explorer registry over IPC `set-windows-context-menu-entry`, not a stored preference — the row must reflect the async registry read and disable itself while `unavailableReason === 'opencode-not-found'` |
| **G48** | `palette:set-context-menu-desktop-material` | Explorer context menu: Open in Desktop Material | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsContextMenuDesktopMaterial` → `settings-context-menu-desktop-material`, `platform: 'win32'`, same registry caveat |
| **G49** | `palette:set-context-menu-modern` | Show in the main Windows 11 menu | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsContextMenuModern` → `settings-context-menu-modern`, `platform: 'win32'`. **Flag:** blocked by `requires-windows-11` / `package-missing` / `developer-mode-required`; a bare switch will silently fail — must degrade to a navigator when `isModernContextMenuActionable()` is false |
| **G50** | `palette:branch-preset-script` | Branch name preset script | `Branch` | **none** (navigator — path + args pair) | `settingsBranchPresetScript` → `settings-branch-preset-script`, only when `enableCustomIntegration()` |
| **G51** | `palette:custom-integrations` | Custom editor and shell commands | `App` | **none** (navigator) | `settingsCustomIntegration` → `settings-custom-integration`. Covers all six custom-editor/custom-shell path/choose/arguments fields, which only render when `useCustomEditor` / `useCustomShell` is already selected |

### B7 · Preferences ▸ Agent access — `PreferencesTab.AgentAccess` (4)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G52** | `palette:set-agent-server-enabled` | Agent server | `App` | `toggle` | `settingsAgentServerEnabled` → `settings-agent-server-enabled` |
| **G53** | `palette:agent-access-mode` | Agent access mode | `App` | **none — navigator, deliberately not a `choice`** | `settingsAgentAccessMode` → `settings-agent-access-mode`. **Flag:** selecting `yolo-lan` fires a `window.confirm` security gate. An in-row select would either bypass that gate or pop a native modal out of the palette. Navigator only. |
| **G54** | `palette:agent-pairing` | Pair a mobile device | `App` | **none** (navigator) | `settingsAgentPairing` → `settings-agent-pairing` |
| **G55** | `palette:agent-token` | Desktop bearer token | `App` | **none — teleport only, never a copy action** | `settingsAgentToken` → `settings-agent-token`. **Flag:** the token is secret material. The palette must not read, echo, or copy it; the row exists only to take the user to the reveal/copy controls that already gate it. Do **not** add a `palette:copy-agent-token`. |

### B8 · Preferences ▸ Automation — `PreferencesTab.Automation` (5)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G56** | `palette:set-auto-commit-push` | Automatically commit and push | `Repository` | `toggle` | `settingsAutoCommitPush` → `settings-auto-commit-push` |
| **G57** | `palette:set-auto-commit-push-interval` | Commit and push interval | `Repository` | `choice` over `AutomationIntervals` (fixed) | `settingsAutoCommitPushInterval` → `settings-auto-commit-push-interval`. Only renders while G56 is on — the row must stay visible and re-enable the parent, or be omitted when off |
| **G58** | `palette:set-auto-pull` | Automatically pull | `Repository` | `toggle` | `settingsAutoPull` → `settings-auto-pull` |
| **G59** | `palette:set-auto-pull-interval` | Pull interval | `Repository` | `choice` over `AutomationIntervals` | `settingsAutoPullInterval` → `settings-auto-pull-interval` |
| **G60** | `palette:automation-account-overrides` | Automation overrides (per account) | `App` | **none** (navigator — 4 selects × N accounts, see Part C) | `settingsAutomationAccountOverrides` → `settings-automation-account-overrides` |

### B9 · Preferences ▸ Clone queue — `PreferencesTab.Queue` (1)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G61** | `palette:queue-clone-settings` | Clone queue settings (per account) | `App` | **none** (navigator) | `settingsQueueAccounts` → `settings-queue-accounts`. The existing `palette:background-queue` already opens this tab; G61 differs only by naming the *settings* rather than the queue. **Merge into `palette:background-queue`'s keywords instead if you prefer one row.** Auto-clone/base-directory/clone-mode are per-account (Part C). |

### B10 · Preferences ▸ Sound — `PreferencesTab.Sound` (15)

Only the navigator `palette:preferences-sound` exists. All 15 below read/write `audioCueStore.getSettings()` — field names verified in `app/src/lib/audio/audio-settings.ts`.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G62** | `palette:set-sound-enabled` | Sound | `App` | `toggle` (`masterEnabled`) | `settingsSoundMaster` → `settings-sound-master` |
| **G63** | `palette:set-sound-effects` | Play sound effects | `App` | `toggle` (`sfxEnabled`) | `settingsSoundEffects` → `settings-sound-effects` |
| **G64** | `palette:set-sound-effect-volume` | Effect volume | `App` | `number` 0–100 step 5 (store holds 0–1 — divide on write) | `settingsSoundEffectVolume` → `settings-sound-effect-volume` |
| **G65** | `palette:set-sound-narrator` | Spoken narrator | `App` | `toggle` (`ttsEnabled`) | `settingsSoundNarrator` → `settings-sound-narrator` |
| **G66** | `palette:set-sound-recorded-narration` | Use recorded narration | `App` | `toggle` (`useRecordedNarration`) | `settingsSoundRecordedNarration` → `settings-sound-recorded-narration` |
| **G67** | `palette:set-sound-narrator-volume` | Narrator volume | `App` | `number` 0–100 step 5 (`ttsVolume`) | `settingsSoundNarratorVolume` → `settings-sound-narrator-volume` |
| **G68** | `palette:set-sound-narrator-cooldown` | Minimum gap between narrated lines | `App` | `number` 2–60 step 1 seconds (store holds `ttsCooldownMs` — ×1000 on write) | `settingsSoundNarratorCooldown` → `settings-sound-narrator-cooldown` |
| **G69** | `palette:set-sound-music` | Play themed music | `App` | `toggle` (`musicEnabled`) | `settingsSoundMusic` → `settings-sound-music` |
| **G70** | `palette:set-sound-music-volume` | Music volume | `App` | `number` 0–100 step 5 (`musicVolume`) | `settingsSoundMusicVolume` → `settings-sound-music-volume` |
| **G71** | `palette:set-sound-quiet-hours` | Mute during quiet hours | `App` | `toggle` (`quietHours.enabled`) | `settingsSoundQuietHours` → `settings-sound-quiet-hours` |
| **G72** | `palette:set-sound-quiet-hours-start` | Quiet hours start | `App` | `number` 0–23 step 1 (`quietHours.startHour`) | `settingsSoundQuietHoursStart` → `settings-sound-quiet-hours-start` |
| **G73** | `palette:set-sound-quiet-hours-end` | Quiet hours end | `App` | `number` 0–23 step 1 (`quietHours.endHour`) | `settingsSoundQuietHoursEnd` → `settings-sound-quiet-hours-end` |
| **G74** | `palette:set-sound-reduced-motion` | Follow reduced motion for sound | `App` | `toggle` (`respectReducedMotion`) | `settingsSoundReducedMotion` → `settings-sound-reduced-motion` |
| **G75** | `palette:repository-music-track` | Music track for this repository | `Repository` | **none** (navigator — native file picker) | `settingsSoundMusicTrack` → `settings-sound-music-track`, `isAvailable: whenRepository` |
| **G76** | `palette:audition-sound-cues` | Audition the sound cues | `App` | **none** (navigator — 15 preview buttons, Part C) | `settingsSoundAudition` → `settings-sound-audition` |

### B11 · Preferences ▸ Copilot & Ollama (5)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G77** | `palette:copilot-commit-model` | Copilot commit-message model | `App` | **none** (navigator — `CopilotModelPicker` is a runtime listbox, **T1**) | `settingsCopilotCommitModel` → `settings-copilot-commit-model`, `tab: PreferencesTab.Copilot` |
| **G78** | `palette:copilot-conflict-model` | Copilot conflict-resolution model | `App` | **none** (navigator, **T1**) | `settingsCopilotConflictModel` → `settings-copilot-conflict-model`. Gated on `enableCopilotConflictResolution()` |
| **G79** | `palette:set-copilot-always-resolve-conflicts` | Always use Copilot when conflicts are detected | `Changes` | `toggle` | `settingsCopilotAlwaysConflicts` → `settings-copilot-always-conflicts` |
| **G80** | `palette:add-ai-provider` | Add an AI provider (BYOK) | `App` | **none** (opens `edit-byok-provider-dialog`) | omit `home` → defaults to `openEvent: 'self'`. The Providers sub-tab only exists when `showBYOKSettings` |
| **G81** | `palette:entry-ollama-endpoint` | Ollama endpoint | `App` | `entry` `maxLength: 2048`, `clearOnApply: false` | `settingsOllamaEndpoint` → `settings-ollama-endpoint`, `tab: PreferencesTab.Ollama`. **Flag:** the Connect button validates loopback/trusted; the palette must run the same check before writing |

### B12 · Repository settings tabs — `RepositorySettingsTab` (9)

Only `CheapLfs` (`palette:cheap-lfs-settings`) and `Automation` (`palette:repository-automation`) are catalogued. Each row below dispatches `showRepositorySettings(tab)` and, per **T5**, omits `home` so `resolvePaletteHome` supplies `{ surface, homeDialog, openEvent: 'self' }` — opening the tab *is* the teleport. All carry `isAvailable: whenRepository`.

| # | event | title | group | `RepositorySettingsTab` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G82** | `palette:repository-remotes` | Repository remotes | `Repository` | `Remote` |
| **G83** | `palette:repository-git-config` | Repository Git config (name and email) | `Repository` | `GitConfig` |
| **G84** | `palette:repository-build-run-settings` | Build & run settings | `Repository` | `BuildRun` |
| **G85** | `palette:repository-submodules` | Submodules | `Repository` | `Submodules` — wants `hasSubmodules` (**T2**) |
| **G86** | `palette:repository-subtrees` | Subtrees | `Repository` | `Subtrees` |
| **G87** | `palette:repository-metadata` | Repository metadata (default branch, editor) | `Repository` | `Metadata` |
| **G88** | `palette:repository-appearance` | Repository appearance | `Repository` | `Appearance` |
| **G89** | `palette:repository-fork-settings` | Fork behaviour | `Repository` | `ForkSettings` — **the tab only renders for forks**; needs `isFork` (**T2**), otherwise the row teleports to a tab that is not there |
| **G90** | `palette:ssh-working-copy` | SSH working copy | `Repository` | `Remote` (sub-section) — same tab as G82, differentiated by keywords |

`Ignored files` is **already covered** by the existing `manage-gitignore`; add `.gitignore ignored files templates` to its `keywords` rather than a new row.

### B13 · Repository settings ▸ Build & run (8)

Each declares `home: { kind: 'surface', labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeRepositorySettings', openEvent: 'palette:repository-build-run-settings', targetId: … }` (**T5** cheap option) and `isAvailable: whenRepository`.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G91** | `palette:set-build-auto-install` | Auto-install missing build tools | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildAutoInstall` → `repo-settings-build-auto-install` |
| **G92** | `palette:set-build-pre-elevate` | Pre-elevate the build chain | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildPreElevate` → `repo-settings-build-pre-elevate` |
| **G93** | `palette:set-build-run-after-build` | Run after a successful build | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildRunAfterBuild` → `repo-settings-build-run-after-build` |
| **G94** | `palette:set-build-auto-ignore-outputs` | Auto-ignore build outputs | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildAutoIgnore` → `repo-settings-build-auto-ignore` |
| **G95** | `palette:set-build-after-pull` | Build after pulling new commits | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildAfterPull` → `repo-settings-build-after-pull` |
| **G96** | `palette:set-build-offer-agents` | Offer Codex/OpenCode to fix build errors | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildOfferAgents` → `repo-settings-build-offer-agents` |
| **G97** | `palette:set-build-fix-provider` | Preferred build-fix provider | `Repository` | `choice` `codex` / `opencode` (fixed) | `repoSettingsBuildFixProvider` → `repo-settings-build-fix-provider`. Same preference is also edited from the OpenCode fix/send dialogs — one catalog row, three surfaces |
| **G98** | `palette:set-build-fix-auto-approve` | Auto-approve the build-fix agent in this repository | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsBuildFixAutoApprove` → `repo-settings-build-fix-auto-approve`. Writes both `buildFixAutoApprove` and the legacy `opencodeAutoApprove` |

### B14 · Repository settings ▸ Cheap LFS (7)

`palette:cheap-lfs-settings` opens the tab; none of its individual controls are catalogued. Each declares `openEvent: 'palette:cheap-lfs-settings'`.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G99** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-auto-materialize` | Download large files after cloning | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsCheapLfsAutoMaterialize` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-auto-materialize` |
| **G100** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-auto-pin` | Pin large files when committing | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsCheapLfsAutoPin` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-auto-pin` |
| **G101** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-clone-helper` | Include the clone helper script | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsCheapLfsCloneHelper` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-clone-helper` |
| **G102** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-parallel-uploads` | Simultaneous Cheap LFS uploads | `Repository` | `number` 1–3 step 1 | `repoSettingsCheapLfsParallelUploads` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-parallel-uploads` |
| **G103** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-storage-provider` | Large-file storage provider | `Repository` | `choice` `release` / `ghcr` / `dockerhub` (fixed) | `repoSettingsCheapLfsStorageProvider` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-storage-provider` |
| **G104** | `palette:set-cheap-lfs-cloud-compression` | Cloud compression for this private repository | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repoSettingsCheapLfsCloudCompression` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-cloud-compression`. **Flag:** disabled and force-on for public repos — the palette switch must be read-only in that state, not silently no-op |
| **G105** | `palette:cheap-lfs-encryption` | Encrypt new Release payloads with a password | `Repository` | **none — navigator, deliberately not a `toggle`** | `repoSettingsCheapLfsEncryption` → `repo-settings-cheap-lfs-encryption`. **Flag:** turning it on requires a password dialog. A palette switch would enable encryption with no key. |

### B15 · Repository tools ▸ signing (3)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G106** | `palette:set-signing-commits` | Sign commits by default | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repositoryToolsSigning` → `repository-tools-signing`, via `openEvent: 'show-repository-tools'`. **Flag:** the UI writes repository Git config only after a review step; the palette must go through the same review, not write directly |
| **G107** | `palette:set-signing-tags` | Sign annotated tags by default | `Repository` | `toggle` | `repositoryToolsSigning`, same caveat |
| **G108** | `palette:signing-policy` | Manage the signing policy | `Repository` | **none** (navigator — includes the free-text signing key) | `home: { kind: 'surface', labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeRepositoryTools', openEvent: 'show-repository-tools', targetId: 'sidebarRepositoryToolsTab' }` |

### B16 · Diff options popover (2)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G109** | `palette:set-diff-auto-expand-context` | Automatically expand whole-file context | `Changes` | `toggle` | `diffOptionsButton` → `diff-options-button` on the popover trigger, `labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeDiffOptions'`, **no `openEvent`** (the preference persists in `diff-context-preferences.ts` and is writable without opening the popover) |
| **G110** | `palette:set-diff-context-step` | Context expansion step | `Changes` | `choice` `20` / `50` / `100` (fixed) | `diffOptionsButton`, same shape |

### B17 · The command palette's own appearance (6)

Persisted in `command-palette-appearance.ts`; reachable today only from the `tune` button beside the palette's filter controls.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G111** | `palette:appearance` | Customize the command palette | `App` | **none** (navigator) | `paletteAppearanceButton` → `palette-appearance-button`, `labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeCommandPalette'` |
| **G112** | `palette:set-palette-density` | Command palette row density | `App` | `choice` `comfortable` / `compact` | `paletteAppearanceButton`. Disabled while G113 is on |
| **G113** | `palette:set-palette-random-per-repository` | Randomize the palette's look per repository | `App` | `toggle` | `paletteAppearanceButton` |
| **G114** | `palette:set-palette-show-icons` | Show icons in palette rows | `App` | `toggle` | `paletteAppearanceButton` |
| **G115** | `palette:set-palette-show-group-chips` | Show group chips in palette rows | `App` | `toggle` | `paletteAppearanceButton` |
| **G116** | `palette:set-palette-show-keywords` | Show the keyword line in palette rows | `App` | `toggle` | `paletteAppearanceButton` |

### B18 · Tabs (8)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G117** | `palette:new-tab-group` | New tab group | `App` | **none** (dialog) | omit `home` |
| **G118** | `palette:edit-tab-group` | Edit the current tab group | `App` | **none** (dialog) | omit `home`. Needs a "a group is selected" predicate (**T2**) |
| **G119** | `palette:close-tabs-containing` | Close tabs containing text | `App` | `entry` `maxLength: 256`, `clearOnApply: true` | `tabStrip` → `tab-strip`, `labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeTabStrip'`, **no `openEvent`**. **Flag:** the shared instructions require a preview + count before any close — the palette entry must open the existing popover pre-filled, never close tabs on Enter |
| **G120** | `palette:close-tabs-not-containing` | Close tabs not containing text | `App` | `entry`, same shape | `tabStrip`, same flag; must negate the identical predicate |
| **G121** | `palette:pin-tab` | Pin the current tab | `App` | **none** | `tabStrip` |
| **G122** | `palette:unpin-tab` | Unpin the current tab | `App` | **none** | `tabStrip` |
| **G123** | `palette:edit-tab-appearance` | Edit the current tab's appearance | `App` | **none** (opens the anchored editor) | `tabStrip` |
| **G124** | `palette:search-tabs` | Search open tabs | `Navigate` | `entry`, `clearOnApply: false` | `tabStrip` |

### B19 · Anchored per-element appearance editors (6)

These editors do not exist in the DOM until opened and are anchored to the element they decorate. The correct catalog shape is a row that **opens the editor for a named element**, whose `targetId` points at that element — not at the editor.

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G125** | `palette:edit-app-appearance` | Edit the app's appearance | `App` | **none** | `appWorkspace` → `app-workspace` (new anchor on the workspace root; mounted from `app.tsx` ~5802) |
| **G126** | `palette:edit-app-identity` | Edit the app name and logo | `App` | **none** | `titleBarBrand` → `title-bar-brand`, `labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeTitleBar'` |
| **G127** | `palette:edit-toolbar-appearance` | Edit the toolbar's appearance | `App` | **none** | **existing** `toolbarRepository` (or a new `toolbar` anchor on the strip itself, which is cleaner) |
| **G128** | `palette:edit-repository-list-appearance` | Edit the repository list's appearance | `App` | **none** | **existing** `repositorySidebar` |
| **G129** | `palette:edit-repository-tabs-appearance` | Edit repository tab appearance | `App` | **none** | `tabStrip` |
| **G130** | `palette:edit-repository-logo` | Edit the repository logo | `Repository` | **none** | via `openEvent: 'palette:repository-appearance'` (G88), `targetId: 'repoSettingsAppearance'` → `repo-settings-appearance` |

### B20 · Remaining dialogs (3)

| # | event | title | group | control | teleport target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G131** | `palette:manage-repository-groups` | Manage repository groups | `App` | **none** (dialog) | omit `home` |
| **G132** | `palette:repository-account` | Repository account | `Repository` | **none** (navigator — account list is runtime, **T1**) | `repoSettingsAccount` → `repo-settings-account`, via `openEvent: 'palette:repository-remotes'` (G82). Only when the repo has a `gitHubRepository` endpoint |
| **G133** | `palette:regex-builder` | Open the regex builder | `Edit` | **none** | `home: { kind: 'surface', labelKey: 'commandPalette.homeCommandPalette' }`. **Flag:** the builder is anchored per search field and there are ~20 of them; a global row has no field to bind to. Scope it explicitly to the palette's *own* search field and say so in `descriptionKey`. |

## PART C — Genuinely cannot be catalogued or teleported to, and why

### C1. Electron `role` menu items — no `MenuEvent`, so `onPaletteCommand`'s `default: → onMenuEvent()` cannot reach them

`undo`, `redo`, `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, `togglefullscreen`, `minimize`, `zoom`, `close`, `front`, `quit`/`E&xit`, `services`, `hide`, `hideOthers`, `unhide`. They are declared as `{ role: … }` in `build-default-menu.ts` and never call `emit()`. Adding them requires new main-process IPC (or `document.execCommand` for the clipboard four) — it is **not** a catalog-only change. Note that `Select All` **is** an `emit('select-all')`, which is why `select-all` is already in the catalog and the others are not.

### C2. Test-menu items — deliberately excluded

Everything under `buildTestMenu()` (crash main/renderer, prune branches, 5 test popups, 9 test banners, 16 test error dialogs, CLI install/uninstall test items, `test-notification`, `test-cli-action`). They render only under `enableTestMenuItems()`, the catalog has no dev-only gate, and shipping them would put "Crash main process" one keystroke from a user's fingers. **Do not add.**

### C3. Unbounded, runtime-generated rows — one catalog entry cannot address "the third one"

| Surface | Rows | Covered instead by |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts tab: Sign in / Add / Make active / Sign out per account (GitHub.com, Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket), GitLab server + token, Bitbucket username + app password | N × 6 | existing `palette:preferences-accounts` |
| Automation ▸ Account overrides: 4 selects × N accounts | 4N | **G60** |
| Clone queue: auto-clone, base directory, clone mode × N accounts | 3N | **G61** / `palette:background-queue` |
| Repository settings ▸ Remote manager: `{remote} remote name`, fetch URL, separate push URL, push URL, stale-branch pruning, tracked default branch | 6N per repo | **G82** |
| Agent access ▸ Paired devices: `Revoke {device}` | N | **G54** |
| Repository logo studio ▸ Layers: mark, text source, custom text, font, weight, letter spacing, layer colour, H/V position, scale, rotation, opacity | 12 per layer × N layers | **G130** |
| Copilot ▸ Providers: `Edit {provider}` / `Remove {provider}` / `Manage models` | 3N | **G80** |
| Sound ▸ Audition each cue: 15 preview buttons | 15 | **G76** |
| Submodules: per-row Configure → submodule config dialog (6 controls) | 6N | **G85** |
| Actions view run filters (Workflow/Branch/Event/Status) | 4, but they are transient view filters, not persisted settings | not a settings gap — exclude |

### C4. Credential and secret surfaces — excluded on policy, not on feasibility

- Agent access **Reveal token** / **Copy agent token** / **Regenerate token**: secret material. G55 teleports to the row; the palette never reads or copies the value.
- SSH key passphrase **Remember passphrase**, SSH user password **Remember password**, Cheap LFS payload password **Remember this password** + its acknowledgement checkbox: these exist only inside a live credential prompt and have no meaning outside it.
- Cheap LFS **Set/Change password** and **Forget password**: see **G105**.

### C5. Per-search-surface state with no global value

`Filter mode` (Fuzzy/Substring/Regex), `Match case`, and `Open regex builder` appear on ~20 search bars and persist **per `searchSurfaceId`** via `app/src/ui/lib/filter-list-mode.ts`. There is no app-wide value for a palette row to show or set. Only **G133**, explicitly scoped to the palette's own field, is meaningful.

### C6. Elements that may not be on screen at teleport time

`teleportTargetSelector()` resolves exactly one DOM node. These anchors exist only conditionally, so a row pointing at them teleports to nothing when the condition is false:

- **Submodule Back button appearance editor** — the button exists only while a submodule workspace is open. No context flag exists (**T2**). Recommend **omitting the row entirely** rather than shipping a dead teleport.
- **G89** fork settings tab — only for forks.
- **G16–G19** formatting rows — only when `enableFormattingPreferences()`.
- **G42/G43** hook-env rows — only when `enableGitHookEnv` (and `__WIN32__` for the shell select).
- **G22** usage stats — only when `ENABLE_TELEMETRY`.
- **G50/G51** custom integrations — only when `enableCustomIntegration()`.
- **G78** Copilot conflict model — only when `enableCopilotConflictResolution()`.
- **Copilot tab itself** — the rail tab renders only when some account passes `enableCopilotSdkCommitMessageGeneration`; the existing `palette:preferences-copilot` already has this latent problem.

### C7. Duplicate surfaces that must map to **one** catalog row, not several

The inventory lists the same persisted preference in more than one place. Catalogue once:

- `buildRun.providerLabel` / `buildRun.autoApproveRepositoryProvider` appear in **Repository settings ▸ Build & run**, the **OpenCode fix dialog**, and the **Send to OpenCode dialog** → **G97 / G98** only.
- `cheapLfs.cloud.privateToggle` appears in **Repository settings ▸ Cheap LFS** and **Repository tools ▸ Cheap LFS manager** → **G104** only.
- The 11 **"Do not show this message again"** checkboxes → the Prompts toggles (existing four + **G27–G33**).
- **App identity editor** is listed twice (as a "Preferences" surface and as an anchored editor) but is one component mounted once from `app.tsx` → **G126** only.
- **Toolbar typography** is listed for both the profile and repository scopes → **G127** covers the profile scope; the repository scope is reached through **G88**.

## Summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Menu commands missing (`MenuEvent`) | **2** (G1–G2) |
| Menu commands missing (main-process click handlers, need new IPC) | **7** (G3–G9) |
| Settings missing, catalogable **with a live control** | **74** |
| Settings missing, catalogable **as navigator rows only** | **41** |
| **Total new catalog entries** | **133** |
| New `TeleportTargetId` keys required | **96** |
| New `commandPalette.home*` label keys required | **7** |
| Type changes required first (T1–T5) | **5** |
| Explicitly excluded, with reason | Electron roles (15), test-menu items (~40), unbounded per-account/per-remote/per-device/per-layer rows (10 families), credential surfaces (6), per-search-surface filter state (3 × ~20 fields), duplicate surfaces (5 families) |

The single highest-leverage prerequisite is **T1** (dynamic choice options): without it, 8 of the 133 entries (G16, G17, G18, G45, G46, G77, G78, G132) must ship as navigator rows even though the user's real intent is to change the value from the palette.
