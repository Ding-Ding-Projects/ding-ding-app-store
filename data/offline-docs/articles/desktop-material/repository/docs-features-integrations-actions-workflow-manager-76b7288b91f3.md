# Actions workflow manager

The **Workflows** tab of the Actions view lists every workflow in the
repository, with a switch per row to enable or disable it, a filter bar wired to
the full regex builder, and — for each workflow — the truthful timing state of
its newest loaded run. The run browser and workflow picker used to launch a run
show the same timing contract on every row.

知每個係行完、行緊、等緊，定暫時量唔到，唔使開網頁逐個㩒入去數。

## Behavior and configuration

Each manager row shows the workflow's icon, its `name:`, and a secondary line
reading `<file> · <state>`, followed by one of these explicit states:

- `Last run <duration>` for the newest completed run.
- `Current run <duration>` for an in-progress run.
- `Latest run: waiting to start` for queued, waiting, pending, or requested
  work.
- `Latest run time unavailable` when provider timestamps are missing,
  malformed, or reversed.
- `No loaded run time` when the loaded page has no run for that workflow.

The main run browser reports `Elapsed <duration>`, `Elapsed: waiting to start`,
or `Elapsed: unavailable` on every run row. The workflow picker in **Run
workflow** uses the same five workflow-level states, so opening a second list
does not make timing disappear. Reviewed bulk re-run/cancel lists retain the
same per-run elapsed label in their confirmation dialog.

The duration answers the question a workflow list is usually opened to answer:
*which of these is the slow one?* Before it existed, comparing two workflows'
cost meant opening each run individually, or leaving the app for the web UI.

Rows are filtered by name or file path from the search field. Plain-text
matching is the default; the adjacent control opens the anchored regex builder,
and the chosen pattern, flags, case sensitivity, and mode apply to that field
only. The filter mode persists per surface under the `actions-workflows` id.

## How the duration is derived

GitHub's workflow-run resource reports no explicit duration or `completed_at`.
The shared model in
`app/src/lib/actions-workflow-run-elapsed.ts` therefore uses:

1. `run_started_at` as the preferred execution boundary.
2. `created_at` only when the provider omits `run_started_at` (older provider
   adapters and fixtures).
3. `updated_at` as the most precise available completion boundary.

The model strictly validates RFC 3339 timestamps and calendar fields. A
present-but-malformed `run_started_at` is not silently replaced with queued
time. For an in-progress run, the end boundary is the current injected wall
clock.

`formatWorkflowRunElapsed` renders that span the way a glance wants it:

| Span | Rendered |
| --- | --- |
| under a minute | `45s` |
| whole minutes | `1m` |
| minutes and seconds | `4m 12s` |
| whole hours | `1h` |
| hours and minutes | `1h 15m` |
| days | `1d 1h 1m 1s` |

A run that completed inside the same second reports `<1s` rather than the false
`0s` or an invented full second.

While a mounted list has a running row, one list-level timer updates all of its
elapsed labels once per second. Workflow-level lists schedule that timer only
when the newest run of an actually rendered, filter-matching workflow is
running; an older superseded run cannot keep it alive. Filter changes resync the
timer immediately. The timer pauses while the document is hidden, restarts with
a fresh clock reading when visible, and is cleared when the list unmounts or the
final visible active run becomes terminal. Completed and not-started lists
schedule no timer.

## Failure modes

The duration is **never omitted or replaced with zero** when it cannot be
stated truthfully. Rows instead say whether the run is waiting to start, timing
is unavailable, or no matching run has been loaded. Missing boundaries,
non-RFC-3339 values, impossible calendar dates, a future start, and an end that
precedes its start or lies in the future all fail closed to unavailable. If any
matching candidate has an unorderable creation timestamp, the workflow-level
result is unavailable; it never falls back to an older run and labels stale
timing as latest.

Because it is derived from runs already loaded into the Actions view, the
figure reflects that bounded provider window. A refresh or store update replaces
it when a newer run arrives; older history is never presented as newer.

## Recovering transient job-log 404 responses

GitHub can briefly answer `404` for a completed job's log endpoint while the log
archive is still being prepared or retained. The endpoint is valid in this
case; treating the first response as permanent made the viewer look broken
until the user reopened the run.

The main-process transfer now retries only this job-log API response, with
bounded waits of **250 ms**, **750 ms**, and **1,500 ms**. Every retry starts at
the original API endpoint and obtains a fresh signed redirect, so a stale blob
URL is never retried and the API bearer is never sent to the cross-origin log
host. Artifact downloads and other HTTP failures keep their existing behavior.

After the bounded sequence is exhausted, the viewer names the actual `HTTP
404` and explains the three likely provider states. It keeps the failure
non-blocking inside the log surface and offers **Retry** plus **Open on GitHub**;
Retry starts the same job again without losing the selected run.

There is no user setting to tune. The fixed bound prevents an unavailable
provider from keeping a renderer request alive indefinitely. Retry attempts do
not consume the separate redirect-hop budget, and the existing abort signal
cancels an in-flight retry delay before another network request can start.

## Force-cancelling a stuck run

A run that ignores an ordinary cancellation cannot be stopped from the Actions
UI — the request is accepted and the jobs keep going. GitHub provides a separate
endpoint for this:

```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/force-cancel
```

Desktop Material exposes it inside the **same reviewed confirmation** as an
ordinary cancel, as a **Force cancel** checkbox rather than a second button, so
the harsher action is chosen deliberately and with the run's identity already on
screen. Ticking it retitles the dialog to *Force-cancel workflow run?* and
relabels the confirm button, so the dialog never says one thing and does
another.

> **What it actually does.** `force-cancel` bypasses conditional evaluation.
> Steps guarded by `if: always()` — cleanup, artifact upload, teardown — **do
> not run**, and jobs are terminated outright. That is precisely why it works on
> a wedged run, and precisely why it is not the default.

Behavioural guarantees:

- The choice is **per confirmation and never remembered**, so a forced
  cancellation cannot be inherited by the next ordinary one.
- Forced and normal requests use **different in-flight keys**. A forced request
  is never deduplicated into a normal one that is already stalling — which is
  exactly the state the user reaches for this in.
- Every progress message says which kind was sent; a forced request never
  reports itself as a normal one.
- The same pre-POST revalidation applies: the run identity, repository, and
  account are rechecked immediately before the request crosses the boundary, and
  an already-terminal run is reported as finished rather than force-cancelled.

## Accessibility and language

Elapsed text wraps at narrow widths and in bilingual mode instead of clipping
the file name, state, or adjacent action. It carries no `title` tooltip. The
visible copy follows English, playful Hong Kong Cantonese, or bilingual mode
live; a separate screen-reader string uses the active primary language so a
bilingual row is not announced twice. Timer updates are not an `aria-live`
region, avoiding a new announcement every second. Existing row roles, selection
semantics, switch targets, and focus order are unchanged.

## Verification

`app/test/unit/main-process/actions-transfer-test.ts` covers a transient API
404 followed by a fresh API redirect and successful blob transfer, the exact
250/750/1,500 ms retry budget, a multi-hop redirect chain after all retries,
abort during backoff without a refetch, bearer-header scope including signed
blob 404s, and the final bounded 404. `app/test/unit/ui/job-log-viewer-test.tsx`
covers the visible error, Retry button, and Open on GitHub link destination and
activation. The built Windows Electron artifact was also
exercised through the cheap headless desktop route: the fixture produced four
bounded 404 attempts, then one successful request after the user activated
Retry, and the captured viewer shows both expected log lines.

`app/test/unit/actions-run-cancellation-store-test.ts` covers force cancellation:
a forced request POSTs to `force-cancel` while a concurrent normal request still
POSTs to `cancel`, the two are not merged, and the forced request's progress
messages identify themselves as forced and never as normal.

`app/test/unit/actions/workflow-run-duration-test.ts` covers formatter
boundaries, strict timestamps, preferred/fallback starts, completed and running
calculations, newest-run selection, pending states, missing data, future starts,
and reversed intervals.

`app/test/unit/ui/actions-parity-test.tsx` and
`app/test/unit/workflow-dispatch-dialog-test.tsx` cover all row labels, live
clock updates, bounded scheduling, hidden-document pause, unmount cleanup,
language switching, concise accessible copy, and the manager/dispatch/run-list
surfaces.
