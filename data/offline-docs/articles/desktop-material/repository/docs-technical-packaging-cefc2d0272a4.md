# Building and Packaging Desktop Material

Desktop Material is built, packaged, tested, and released as a Windows-only
application. The repository retains some inherited upstream platform adapters,
but macOS and Linux packages are not supported product outputs.

## Build pipeline

`yarn build:prod` uses the Webpack configuration under `app/` and
`script/build.ts` to create the production renderer, main process, crash view,
syntax highlighter, CLI, styles, source maps, licenses, and staged Electron
resources. The canonical product version is `app/package.json#version`.

The CI workflow builds Windows x64 and Windows arm64 on `windows-2022` by
default. A trusted `workflow_dispatch` may select the fixed
`desktop-material-windows-local` runner for those desktop build jobs; the
Windows TUI core job remains on `windows-2022`, and pushes, pull requests, and
reusable calls cannot select the self-hosted label. Windows x64 runs the full
unit suite, and both architectures run the script tests and packaging gate. The
supported packaged end-to-end lane installs and exercises Windows x64.

## Windows packaging

`yarn package` runs `script/package.ts` and `electron-winstaller` to create:

- a portable ZIP containing the complete packaged Windows application tree;
- a Squirrel current-user setup executable;
- a Windows Installer (`.msi`) package;
- NuGet packages and the `RELEASES` update-feed manifest.

The portable archive is not CI-only: a local Windows x64 production build
followed by `yarn package` writes `dist/GitHub Desktop-x64.zip` alongside the
installer outputs. This provides a directly movable build even when a remote
release run is unavailable. It contains the packaged application directory,
so extract the ZIP before starting the executable.

`script/windows-portable-zip.ts` uses the native
`%SystemRoot%\System32\tar.exe` ZIP writer so archive data is streamed instead
of retained in Node memory and ZIP64-capable tooling handles large package
entries. It writes to a controlled `.partial.zip`, lists the completed archive
to reject truncation or corruption, requires a non-empty result, and atomically
renames it to the final path. A stale destination or failed partial archive is
removed rather than mistaken for the current package. The destination must stay
outside the packaged source tree.

The automated release workflow publishes the x64 portable ZIP, setup
executable, MSI, `RELEASES`, and both exact-name copies of the full NuGet
package. It verifies that every required asset is non-empty before publication.
Automatic and Super Express packages share the validated
`<base>-z<9-letter-base-26-GitHub-run-ID>` version namespace so Squirrel can
order Releases across both lanes. The leading `z` migrates installations from
the older incompatible `b…` and `s…` namespaces; the alphabetic payload also
avoids the installed legacy comparer's 32-bit overflow on modern numeric run
IDs.
Windows packaging is permanently unsigned. Every package lane disables
certificate auto-discovery, clears Windows signing and Azure identity inputs,
and verifies that both the setup executable and MSI report `NotSigned`. A
signature or attempted signer invocation fails the build. Release notes warn
that the unsigned artifacts may trigger Windows SmartScreen or an
unknown-publisher prompt.

The direct `.github/workflows/super-express-release-windows.yml` build and
publish jobs both use
`[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]`. The publisher
downloads and rechecks the package, stages and validates a unique draft, then
publishes it as a uniquely tagged non-Latest Release. Exact workflow timing is
written and verified before Latest reconciliation. A same-job failure removes
the captured release and exact new tag, then restores the prior Latest. It never
reuses or overwrites an earlier tag.

## Publication boundary

`.github/workflows/build-installers.yml` runs only after the complete CI
workflow succeeds for `main`. It checks out the exact CI SHA, proves that SHA is
an eligible `main` push, requires a new unique release tag, builds and packages
Windows x64, revalidates the tag, and publishes one immutable non-draft Release.
A successful target superseded during the build remains published but
non-latest. The shared promotion helper only advances the update feed for
current `main`, reconciles the greatest valid same-SHA version, and demotes a
candidate if `main` changes during promotion. A failed CI publishes no Release.

Linux runners used for lint, Pages, or CodeQL are infrastructure only. They do
not produce Linux application packages. No macOS build, signing, packaging, or
E2E lane is part of the supported pipeline.

## Failure modes and verification

Build, unit, script, package, archive-create/list, installed-E2E, missing-asset,
unexpected-signature, invalid-version, existing-tag, and remote-query failures
stop release publication. A stale post-build head preserves its immutable
Release without promoting it to the updater feed.
The tracked CI safety test enforces the Windows-only matrix, requires the x64
portable ZIP as a non-empty release asset, and rejects macOS runners or Apple
signing inputs in the application workflow. Portable-ZIP and CI focused checks
passed 11/11 along with script TypeScript and focused lint, format, and diff
checks. The combined changed-surface gate passed 165/165 across 18 suites. A
complete remote package receipt now exists: exact-source
[CI `29977738533`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29977738533)
and
[Build Installers `29978844761`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29978844761)
succeeded for `04246fdf12c09446b88d2f40130581d603131c8e`. Release
[`v3.6.3-beta3-zadtberjmv`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/releases/tag/v3.6.3-beta3-zadtberjmv)
published the portable ZIP, setup EXE, MSI, `RELEASES`, and both full NuGet
package names as six non-empty assets. Installed Squirrel acceptance proved the
legacy `s000000000201` migration, and
[Super Express run `29980281736`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/actions/runs/29980281736)
published the greater same-SHA `v3.6.3-beta3-zadtbhvdfc` package that reached
the real update-ready UI.
