# Linux TUI installation and packaging

> **Current release path:** the Linux TUI wheel, source distribution, locked
> runtime constraints, bootstrap, and installer are built and tested as release
> payloads. The Windows Electron packaging lanes remain separate.

## Runtime boundary

- x86-64 or ARM64 GNU/Linux with glibc (musl is not currently compatible with
  the required published RE2 wheel);
- a UTF-8 terminal with at least 80 columns; 100 or more is recommended;
- terminal mouse reporting for click and wheel interaction;
- network access to the project release and pinned upstream tool releases during
  installation.

The fresh-machine installer supplies Git, SSH, certificates, `gh`, `uv`, and a
managed Python 3.12 runtime. The TUI is pure Python except for the published
`google-re2` wheel. Installation fails rather than silently replacing RE2 with
Python's backtracking regular-expression engine.

## Contributor checkout route

The locked contributor path is:

```bash
cd tui
uv sync --locked --extra dev
uv run desktop-material-tui
```

Open a repository on startup:

```bash
uv run desktop-material-tui /path/to/repository
```

The short entry point is equivalent:

```bash
uv run dmt /path/to/repository
```

Useful non-interactive checks are:

```bash
uv run desktop-material-tui --version
uv run desktop-material-tui --help
```

`--theme dark|light|system` and `--language en|yue-HK|bilingual` are accepted
run-level choices. Persistent choices live in Settings.

## Fresh-machine installation route

Use the single copy-and-paste command in the repository's
[Install guide](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.1e1a5fc33dbd396e#install-the-linux-tui-on-a-fresh-machine).
The command has no preinstalled developer-tool requirement: it detects the
native package manager and installs `ca-certificates` plus `curl` before running
the release bootstrap. The checked-in source of that bootstrap is
`script/bootstrap-linux-tui.sh`; it
downloads the full installer to a bounded temporary file, validates its shell
header, and delegates the remaining work.

The full installer:

- supports `apt-get`, `dnf5`, `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, and `pacman`;
- uses root, `sudo`, or `doas` only for the fixed native package list;
- pins and verifies the supported `gh` archive by architecture and SHA-256;
- resolves a non-draft project release whose wheel and constraints carry
  GitHub-provided SHA-256 digests, then verifies size and digest again locally;
- installs into a user-owned `uv tool` environment and refuses path collisions
  with unrelated executables;
- writes one managed, replaceable `PATH` block to supported shell profiles;
- records owned paths so a repeat run is idempotent without claiming unrelated
  files;
- never asks for or embeds a credential.

Close and reopen the terminal so the updated `PATH` is loaded. Then run
`github` in the current repository or `github /path/to/repository`. Open and
Clone default their folder chooser to the process's current working directory.

From an existing trusted local checkout:

```bash
uv tool install ./tui
github /path/to/repository
```

The installed `github`, `dmt`, and `desktop-material-tui` commands are
identical launchers. The literal `github` alias is convenient and does not
replace GitHub CLI's `gh`. If another program or shell alias already owns that
name, use `dmt` or `desktop-material-tui` instead. From a repository:

```bash
github --help
github status --json
github push --dry-run
github pull --ff-only
github git status --short
```

The Open/Create dialog provides a clickable folder browser. Bracketed or
Textual clipboard paste immediately unwraps one matching pair of outer quotes;
submission applies the same normalization for typed paths and terminals
without bracketed-paste reporting. Direct `github push` and `github pull` are
Cheap-LFS-aware; the explicit `github git …` form passes other native Git argv
through. See
[Repository path browser and quoted paste](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.b4622a1876d97e25) and the
[Cheap LFS Git wrapper](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.a7cdbfe097141946) for their exact contracts.

`pipx install ./tui` is an optional checkout route. A release wheel can
be installed with:

```bash
uv tool install ./desktop_material_tui-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Do not download an artifact from an unrelated workflow or fork and present it
as a project release. The installer accepts only a complete payload attached to
a non-draft, non-prerelease release in the expected repository.

## Build and inspect packages

```bash
cd tui
uv build --clear
python -m zipfile -l dist/desktop_material_tui-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The build produces:

- `desktop_material_tui-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`;
- `desktop_material_tui-0.2.0.tar.gz`.

The wheel must contain the console entry points, `py.typed`, the Python
packages, `ui/styles.tcss`, and the verified local dim-sum catalog. The source distribution additionally carries
tests, the locked environment, and the parity contract. Generated `dist/`,
virtual environments, bytecode, and coverage data are build outputs and are not
source.

## CI contract

The `Linux TUI` job in `.github/workflows/ci-linux.yml` runs on Ubuntu for the declared
Python matrix. Environments install from `uv.lock` and run the test suite. The
packaging lane additionally checks the generated parity contract, runs Ruff and
mypy, builds both distributions, installs the wheel into a fresh virtual
environment, checks its version entry point, and uploads the packages.

The tested Express release workflow attaches the wheel, source distribution,
lock-derived runtime constraints, `bootstrap-linux-tui.sh`, and
`install-linux-tui.sh` after its Linux tests and Debian acceptance container.
The emergency Super Express dispatcher has its own self-hosted-only packaging
workflow, `.github/workflows/super-express-release-linux-tui.yml`, which runs
on the registered Linux x64 WSL runner. It skips those tests for speed but
still builds the same complete TUI payload and publishes it beside the Windows
assets in one combined Release. Debian 13 gets its managed Python 3.12 from
`uv python install 3.12`, rather than from a hosted-runner Python manifest.
That Linux lane is also directly dispatchable from `main` for a packaging-only
recovery artifact; it does not publish by itself.

A separate Windows Server 2022/Python 3.12 lane runs the non-PTY unit,
application, infrastructure, Cheap LFS, lint, and type-check core. It is a
cross-platform-core regression gate, not a claim that the Linux-first terminal
interaction or PTY acceptance runs on Windows. Both TUI lanes are additive.
They do not weaken or replace the Electron edition's Windows x64/arm64 build
and packaged Windows x64 E2E gates.

## Upgrade and uninstall

Upgrade a checkout installation by fetching a reviewed ref and repeating
`uv tool install --force ./tui`. For pipx, use
`pipx reinstall desktop-material-tui` from the same trusted source.

Remove the executable with `uv tool uninstall desktop-material-tui` or
`pipx uninstall desktop-material-tui`. Uninstalling the package deliberately
does not delete app data. Review the
[XDG paths](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.06a725ac6163a376) before removing configuration,
notification history, or version snapshots.

## Docker installation

The repository also provides a multi-stage, non-root container image. Build it
from the local checkout and launch it against a bind-mounted repository with
explicit persistent XDG volumes. Copy-paste commands, the mount map, credential
boundary, SELinux note, and failure modes are in the
[container guide](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.235ef21b88b0aba2).

## Failure modes

- `git` missing: repository validation and operations report an error; install
  Git and retry.
- `gh` missing or signed out: local Git stays available; the GitHub tab reports
  the missing prerequisite without opening a credential prompt.
- unsupported Python: the package installer refuses it.
- RE2 wheel unavailable for a platform: installation fails closed; do not
  substitute a different regex engine.
- `github` not found after installation: open a new terminal or source the
  installer-managed profile block. If another program or alias already owns
  `github`, use the identical `dmt` or `desktop-material-tui` launcher; the
  installer refuses to overwrite an unrelated executable.
- narrow terminal: content reflows and scrolls, but a terminal below the
  documented minimum may be impractical.
- wheel omits `styles.tcss`: packaged startup is a release blocker.
