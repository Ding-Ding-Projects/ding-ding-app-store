# User Guide

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: The everyday repository loop from inspecting changes through safe synchronization.*

The safest rhythm is simple: inspect, stage, commit, then synchronize. The tools below add power without changing that basic loop.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: A conceptual safe Git workflow from working files to reviewed cloud synchronization.*

A task-oriented tour of Desktop Material's features. It assumes you already know the basic GitHub
Desktop workflow (clone, commit, push, branch, pull request) — that all still works. This guide
focuses on what Desktop Material adds on top.

**Feature guide**

The numbered roadmap now extends through M27. M0–M21 and M23 have published
receipts; M22 keeps its separate visual refresh, and the acceptance/publication
state for M24–M27 is recorded in the repository's `ROADMAP.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.
The July 22 feature continuation is published at `f7b4760a13` with exact-source
CI, code scanning, Pages/wiki, and six-asset Windows installer Release
verification. Updater recovery commits `241cc90ce9` and `04246fdf12` are also
published and were accepted from an installed legacy build through the new
alphabetic-`z` release lane. July 23 Cheap LFS registry storage and automatic
push batching and the responsive Releases correction are published through
`c22e29a03a`. Exact-source cloud, CI, CodeQL, Pages, and installer run
`30057456712` passed; the latter published immutable six-asset Release
`v3.6.3-beta3-zadthusbjk`. The live Bambu cloud/verifier and initial 10/10 clone
integrity proofs are complete; the serialized materialization correction keeps
its final UI receipt in `HANDOFF.md`.

The July 27 app-hosted browser, exact-90% Cheap LFS restore look-ahead, and
private-repository lock passed the final focused **760/760 across 58 files**
gate, 14/14 verifier contracts, full TypeScript, the exact Windows production
build, and isolated hidden-desktop interaction/privacy review. The source and
captures are pushed through `2abccae8fd`, and Pages/wiki publication is
verified live. Packaged Windows E2E is verified. Installer/Release evidence
remained pending at that dated checkpoint; the archived TUI compatibility work
is outside the current Windows acceptance boundary.

The temporary-submodule changeset completed its local ten-pass, final post-build
child/Back, and fresh-bundle duplicate Open/Back race inspections, including
read-only mutation boundaries and owned headless-resource cleanup. Initial
remote CI caught a macOS error-ordering defect without publishing; correction
`98d93ccc` passed its full remote CI gate and published
`v3.6.3-beta3-b0000000165`. Exact publication receipts are in `HANDOFF.md`.

The Guided Feature Gallery declares the canonical 91-scene
Windows visual target: every catalogued function or state must own one distinct
screenshot rather than borrow an overview image. The current-source updater
frame is accepted and published as its own target; it does not replace the
immutable historical migration frame. Five earlier Linux/Xvfb captures remain
archived outside that target set.

## Advanced Git and collaboration workflows

M21 adds progressively disclosed controls around the familiar Desktop flow:

- Use the repository sheet to search, filter by account/provider/status, pin or
  hide repositories, and run Pull/Fetch All only after reviewing the exact
  selected subset. History can switch between the current branch and all refs
  to reveal commits that exist only on remote branches or tags.
- Open a pull request workspace to inspect its summary, checks, changed-file
  tree, and expanded diff context; comment and reply, resolve conversations,
  submit an approval or change request, and update supported metadata. The
  creation composer discovers bounded repository templates and optional
  metadata before an immutable final review. Fork checkout separately reviews
  the exact source repository, branch, and commit before fetching.
- Open Stash Manager to create a named stash from selected files or manage any
  stash visible to Git, including entries made outside the app. Repository
  Tools exposes tag creation, fetch, push, move, signing, pruning, and deletion;
  destructive tag and bulk-branch actions identify the exact refs first and
  retain recovery information.
- When switching away from a dirty branch, choose **Leave my changes here** to
  keep the current files in place and open Add worktree with the destination
  branch and a suggested worktree name already filled in. The current worktree
  is not stashed or checked out to the destination; creation happens only after
  the path review succeeds.
- In Changes, switch the file list to a directory tree, choose persisted diff
  context, compare CSV/TSV rows and cells, and preview TGA images. Editor actions
  understand the expanded editor catalog plus WSL paths. Settings and Repository
  Tools expose global-ignore editing, allowlisted custom Git presets, reviewed
  patch import/export, and network/WSL path diagnostics.
- Open GitHub Projects from Repository Tools for the current account-bound
  repository. A successful bounded load refreshes the local cache; while
  offline, the workspace labels and shows only the last-known-good snapshot.

The complete [30-item feature ledger](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.f39bdcae25483817)
links to behavior, recovery, security, and test details for every workflow.

## Historical Linux TUI prototype (unsupported)

The commands below reproduce the July 27 prototype acceptance record. They are
not a current installation recommendation; Desktop Material's supported
product and package path is Windows. At that checkpoint the prototype required
Git, Python 3.10–3.13, and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Linux shell:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material.git && cd desktop-material && uv tool install ./tui && uv tool update-shell
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material.git; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'git clone failed' }; Set-Location .\desktop-material; uv tool install .\tui; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'uv tool install failed' }; uv tool update-shell
```



Close and reopen the terminal afterward so the updated `PATH` is loaded. Then
run `github /path/to/repository` on Linux or
`github C:\path\to\repository` on Windows. The interactive acceptance target
was Linux-first; the Windows Terminal launch path and cross-platform core were
also tested at that checkpoint.

The same launcher provides Cheap-LFS-aware Git commands:

```bash
github -C /path/to/repository push --dry-run
github -C /path/to/repository push origin main
github -C /path/to/repository pull --ff-only
github -C /path/to/repository git status --short
```

Open/Create also has a clickable folder browser. Bracketed or Textual clipboard
paste unwraps one matching pair of single or double quotes immediately without
evaluating shell syntax; submission applies the same normalization as a
fallback. See the
[complete TUI installation guide](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.30996ac7fda66789)
for package, upgrade, Docker, security, and failure-mode details.

---

## Install on Windows

Desktop Material's automated releases provide an x64 per-user installer. The
Windows package command also creates `GitHub Desktop-x64.zip`, and the gated
release job requires that portable ZIP beside the installer and update-feed
assets. Open Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7 as your normal user and run:

```powershell
Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-RestMethod 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/main/script/install-windows.ps1' | Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-Expression
```

The command loads the
tracked installer script
from this repository. The script then:

1. queries `Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material` for its newest non-draft,
   non-prerelease GitHub release;
2. requires exactly one installer matching the native Windows architecture and
   validates that its HTTPS URL belongs to this repository;
3. checks the reported byte count and GitHub SHA-256 release-asset digest, then
   requires any Authenticode signature to be valid;
4. runs the per-user Squirrel installer with its supported `--silent` flag;
5. requires Squirrel to exit zero and verifies the installed postcondition; and
6. removes the installer from its unique, bounded temporary directory.

For automation, invoke the reviewed script as a script block and choose the
explicit current-user operation:

```powershell
$installer = [scriptblock]::Create((Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-RestMethod 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/main/script/install-windows.ps1'))
& $installer -Operation Install -InstallScope CurrentUser
& $installer -Operation Update -InstallScope CurrentUser
& $installer -Operation Uninstall -InstallScope CurrentUser
```

`Install` may refresh a complete existing installation. `Update` requires one.
Install uses the downloaded, digest-verified setup asset. Update invokes the
installed updater against the exact immutable release-tag feed with
`--update=<url> --silent`, preserving normal Squirrel update behavior instead
of performing a full reinstall. `Uninstall` is idempotent when the app is
already absent and otherwise invokes the installed
`Update.exe --uninstall --silent`; no executable is downloaded for removal.
Every operation refuses a partial installation and asks for a running app to be
closed normally instead of force-killing it. Squirrel has a 15-minute process
deadline and its installed/removed postcondition has a one-minute deadline;
nonzero exit codes and missing postconditions are failures. Use `-ResolveOnly`
to inspect the exact plan without changing the machine.

The application scope is always `CurrentUser` under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubDesktop`. `AllUsers` is rejected. The generated MSI is a
machine deployment bootstrapper which schedules the same per-user setup at
logon, not a conventional machine-wide Desktop Material payload. Run mutating
operations in a normal, non-administrator PowerShell session; the script
rejects elevation before Squirrel can show its unsupported-elevation error. It
also preflights Squirrel's .NET Framework 4.5 minimum instead of opening a
framework installer or reboot prompt during an unattended install.

Windows release workflows permanently publish unsigned x64 installers.
Packaging and publication require the setup executable and MSI to report
`NotSigned`; release notes warn that Windows may show SmartScreen or an
unknown-publisher prompt. The script reports the missing signature after
verifying the GitHub digest, and it stops rather than selecting a different
package on ARM64 or 32-bit Windows. To
inspect or download the asset yourself, use the
[latest release page](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/releases/latest).
When the portable ZIP is present, download and extract it before starting the
packaged executable; it does not run the Squirrel installer. The published
baseline already contains the required installer, feed, and portable ZIP
assets. The verified updater-migration Releases contain all six required
installer, feed, NuGet, MSI, and portable-ZIP assets.

While GitHub Actions is actively building a newer exact `main` commit, the
About updater can show **New update coming soon** (or the selected Cantonese or
bilingual equivalent). This remote state is never persisted and cannot make an
update installable. Once the Release exists, the next normal update check takes
over. Each automated Release lists bounded, sanitized commit subjects from the
previous installer release through its exact target SHA. CI, installer, and
Pages invocations use independent per-run groups, so a newer run never cancels
or replaces older running or pending work.

Automatic and Super Express installers now use the same fixed-width alphabetic
`z` version lane. This lets an older Super Express installation move forward
instead of treating a newer ordinary Release as a downgrade. Live acceptance
started from `3.6.3-beta3-s000000000201`: the ordinary updater automatically
selected, downloaded, and applied `3.6.3-beta3-zadtberjmv`; a following
same-source Super Express Release then progressed visibly through **Downloading
update…** to **Quit and Install Update**.

The current-source development frame below separately proves runtime source
`b069384ad7d8a65d1192ee06859a705fe484c9c8` reaching the ready state through
the real Electron/Squirrel event path. Its disclosed verifier-owned payload was
inert, so this is UI-path evidence rather than a claim that the payload was
published. Promotion `e3967f1b81ec039624500797dca40a1ab6d98598` records the
inspected 960×660, 47,086-byte PNG with SHA-256
`0fc9caf5b13eb5b914121090f403c394545e02ea4303b11dd4598afcb3a2dfca`.

## Creating a GitHub release

Open **Repository → Release Manager** and select **New release**. Enter the tag,
target, name, and notes. **Publish immediately** is enabled by default; leave it
enabled, select **Review changes**, verify that Publication says **Publish
immediately**, and select **Publish release**. Desktop Material sends one direct
public-release request rather than creating a draft first. Turn **Publish
immediately** off only when you intentionally want an unpublished draft.
Review the tracked script before running any remote command.

---

## CI test reliability

The supported Windows build and the retained Linux TUI checks install their
declared dependencies from the committed manifests. The Linux Python 3.13
check runs non-UI tests together and gives every UI test file a fresh Python
interpreter because Textual's native syntax state can otherwise segfault after
several app-heavy files share one process. All test files still run; only the
process boundary changes. Python 3.10 and 3.12 use the ordinary full-suite
command.

The same runner can be inspected at
`tui/tools/run-tests-isolated.py`.
It discovers test files rather than maintaining a hand-written allowlist, so
adding a new UI file does not silently remove it from CI.

---

## The shell

Desktop Material rebuilds the GitHub Desktop shell around Material Design 3. The chrome you work in
every day is made of a few pieces:

- **A left icon navigation rail** with entries for **Changes** (with a count badge), **History**,
  **Branches**, **Settings**, and your **account avatar** at the bottom.
- **A floating pill toolbar** across the top carrying repository, worktree, branch, and sync
  controls. When the measured width gets tight, **Build & Run** moves into the keyboard-accessible
  **More toolbar actions** surface first, then **Commit & Push** follows. Widening the window
  restores each action automatically before its label can clip. For GitHub-backed repositories,
  the branch control also shows a small colour-coded CI logo for the current commit; hover it for
  the result, such as **CI checks: successful**.
- **Browser-like repository tabs** (see [Repository tabs](#repository-tabs)) above the workspace.
- **Floating, radius-24 workspace cards** for Changes, the diff, History, and the empty/welcome
  states, with tri-state selection checkboxes, tonal status chips, token-based diff colors, and an
  inverse-surface undo banner.

The whole shell has an **animated light/dark theme**. Everything below tells you how to drive it.
On Windows, one uninterrupted bare Alt press toggles the application menu. A
held key remains one press, while Alt plus another key, another modifier, a
handled event, or a modal transition cancels that sequence cleanly so a stale
release cannot affect the next Alt press.
While an app update downloads, a thin indeterminate progress bar appears at the
top of the workspace. Choose **Settings → Appearance → Update progress color**
to inherit the accent or select blue, violet, teal, green, amber, or rose.
These update controls, the current-commit CI status tooltip, and the temporary
submodule-navigation copy use the explicit language mode saved under
**Language**: English, playful Hong Kong Cantonese, or a compact
bilingual presentation. English is the fallback; the operating-system locale
does not silently replace the saved choice.

## Material first run

The welcome page is a Material task surface rather than a separate stock onboarding skin. It keeps
the **Sign in with GitHub.com**, **GitHub Enterprise**, and **Continue without signing in** routes in
one focused card, preserves keyboard focus and sign-in progress, and explains that repositories stay
local to the device. A tonal preview introduces the repository-focused workspace; at compact window
sizes the preview steps away so the setup task remains unclipped.

## The dim sum surprise

About **one launch in ten**, a small photograph of a Hong Kong dim sum dish appears in the
bottom-left corner, named in English and Traditional Chinese — *Classic Har Gow · 蝦餃* — and clears
itself after about nine seconds.

It is a delight, not a system. It never delays the app becoming usable, never takes keyboard focus,
and is not a dialog you have to dismiss; the labelled close button only saves you the wait. It stays
away entirely on a first run, when startup has failed, while an update is in flight, while a
blocking dialog is open, and inside your configured quiet hours. A launch it stays away from simply
has no surprise; it does not lie in wait for the dialog to close.

Each dish's name is a fact rather than a joke: it reads identically in every language mode and at
every playfulness level, and only the order changes (Cantonese mode leads with 蝦餃). The copy
*around* the name follows your two playfulness sliders, each language at its own level. The
photographs ship with the app — twelve of them, no network request, no tracking — and the picture's
alt text names the dish in both languages so it reaches screen-reader users too.

**There is no setting to switch it off**, and if an older profile stored one, it is deleted on the
next launch so that profile simply rejoins the draw.

Full detail: [The dim sum surprise](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.7866b4fb2a20d1ac).

## Signing in

Open **Settings → Accounts** to manage sign-ins. Desktop Material supports **multiple accounts at
once** and, unlike stock GitHub Desktop, **multiple identities on the same host** — for example two
GitHub.com accounts, or a work and a personal GitHub Enterprise identity side by side.

### Add a GitHub / GitHub Enterprise account

1. In **Settings → Accounts**, choose **Add account**.
2. Pick **GitHub.com** or **GitHub Enterprise** and complete the browser sign-in.
3. The new identity appears in the accounts list. You can add another on the same host without
   signing the first one out.

Each account keeps its **own tabs, repositories, and settings**. Switching the active account
switches the whole workspace to that identity's context.

The **Active** chip and **Make active** action in **Settings → Accounts** use
the same one-account-global rule as the rail switcher, including across
GitHub.com, Enterprise, GitLab, and Bitbucket sections. A repository with an
explicit **Repository account** binding remains on that exact identity until a
user deliberately promotes another GitHub identity on the same API endpoint
while that repository is selected; the selected repository then follows the
choice for its next authenticated operation. Other repositories, hosts, and
providers keep their existing bindings.

The account picker and the navigation-rail account switcher are rich rows rather than login-only
menus: they show the friendly name, `@login · host`, provider, plan, and a visible display email
when one exists, with the active identity marked. Private email values are not searchable, and
self-hosted accounts keep their self-hosted label. Their search bar is plain-text by default and
offers fuzzy, substring, and bounded safe-regex modes through the anchored Regex Builder. Search
by name, login, host, provider, plan, or visible email; use Arrow keys, Home/End,
Enter, and Escape without leaving the surface. Invalid patterns are announced
inline and cannot activate the first row; no-match states leave **Add another account** available.
The searchable metadata never includes a credential token. Stable `endpoint#id` row identities also
keep a login rename from selecting a different account.

Open the repositories side sheet to narrow cloned repositories by **Repository account** and
**Repository service**. The filters combine: for example, choose one exact account and GitLab, or
choose **No available account** and **Local only**. Signed-out/stale bindings remain explicit under
**Unknown or signed out**; the app does not guess a provider from a hostname.

GitHub browser sign-in requests only the feature scopes used by Desktop Material:
repository/user access, workflow-file updates, notifications, read-only
organization membership, and GHCR package read/write for Cheap LFS. It does not
request repository deletion, package deletion, administrative keys, Codespaces,
audit-log access, or gists. An older sign-in without package access is offered
reauthorization before GHCR storage can use that account.

### Add a self-hosted GitLab account

Desktop Material signs in to self-hosted GitLab with an **endpoint + personal access token (PAT)**
rather than a browser OAuth flow:

1. In **Settings → Accounts**, choose **Add account → GitLab (self-hosted)**.
2. Enter your instance **endpoint** (for example `https://gitlab.example.com`).
3. Paste a **personal access token** with the scopes you need (typically `api`, `read_repository`,
   `write_repository`).
4. Save. The GitLab identity now behaves like any other account — its repos are browsable and
   cloneable, and it can own its own tabs.

> Bitbucket and hosted GitLab integrations follow the same pattern. Tokens are stored with your
> platform credential store and are **never exposed** through the agent API.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: GitLab and Bitbucket account controls.*

### Browse organizations and publish into one

When a GitHub account belongs to organizations, the clone view loads the account's organization
list and adds filter chips. Select an organization to browse its complete repository list; if one
organization fails to load, the view reports that error without hiding the repositories already
available.

The **Publish repository** dialog presents that ownership choice as a
searchable listbox. **None** publishes to the personal account, while the other
rows select an organization. The search supports fuzzy, substring, and bounded
safe-regex modes plus the full Regex Builder. Invalid regex keeps every owner
reachable and reports the pattern problem inline. Arrow keys,
Home/End, and Enter/Space work from
the keyboard. On narrow windows the search tools wrap above a list with its own
scroll, so the owner rows and the dialog actions remain reachable.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Bilingual Publish repository dialog with a visible, searchable organization listbox.*

### Assign an account to a repository

Repository-bound provider features use **Repository settings → Repository account** as their one
source of truth. If Provider Triage opens while the repository is unassigned, Desktop Material
automatically uses the account only when exactly one signed-in identity matches the provider and
endpoint. With multiple matches, choose a labelled account and select **Use this account**; this
prevents cross-account API calls. With no match, use **Sign in** or **Manage accounts**.

If the saved account has been signed out, lost permission, or needs organization SSO, the tool asks
you to re-authenticate or authorize SSO instead of claiming the repository is unassigned. Changing
the account in Repository Settings propagates to Provider Triage immediately; an existing valid
explicit binding is never silently replaced.

The same repository account controls HTTPS Git network work: normal and scheduled **Fetch**,
**Pull**, **Push**, the post-push refresh, pull-request refspec fetches, and remote default-branch
lookup. A saved account that is unavailable fails safely rather than falling back to another
GitHub.com identity. For an older unassigned repository, Desktop Material verifies same-host
accounts against the remote and prefers an account that can push before a read-only account, then
saves that verified choice for later operations.

When GitHub reports that the repository was renamed or transferred, Desktop Material updates the
exact matched default remote before network work. It keeps SSH as SSH and accepts an HTTP(S) change
only on the same exact scheme, host, and port. An explicit push URL moves only when it exactly
matched the old fetch URL; a separate deployment or write-only target remains untouched. Concurrent
remote edits win, unsafe candidates are refused, and a provider/config failure leaves the current
URL in place for a later explicit retry. See [Automatic remote URL
refresh](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/blob/main/docs/features/repository-management/automatic-remote-url-refresh.md) for the complete safety
and retry behavior.

During background fetch, a local `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` is reused only when it points inside
that exact remote namespace and its target still exists. This avoids an expensive online
default-branch scan on every scheduled refresh. Missing, malformed, dangling, or cross-remote refs
still run one lookup with the repository's selected account. An explicit Fetch always refreshes
the default with a five-second discovery deadline plus one final five-second process-cleanup grace
window, so a generic host's rename is detected even when its old branch still exists and a missing
child-process close event cannot hang the completed fetch. Concurrent preparations for the same
remote URL share one in-flight system proxy lookup instead of multiplying resolver work after a
timeout. Clone cancellation remains stricter and waits for the owned process to close completely.

### Transfer a repository to another account

Open **Repository → Transfer repository…**, choose **Transfer repository** from
the repository-list context menu or Command Palette, or use the button in
**Repository settings → Remote**. The dialog starts with the source repository
and offers every signed-in GitHub identity. Choose **Sign in to another
account…** when the destination identity is not present; the normal GitHub.com
or GitHub Enterprise sign-in flow returns to this dialog without exposing the
credential to the page.

Choose a personal or organization owner, keep the existing repository name or
enter a custom provider-safe name, and choose whether the destination is
private. **Full history** creates a temporary bare clone and pushes every local
branch and tag. **Clean state** creates one new root commit from the current
files, pushes the current branch, and keeps the previous tip in a local
`refs/desktop-material/transfer-backups/` recovery ref. Both modes require a
valid Git operation state; full-history mode requires a clean worktree, while
clean-state mode intentionally includes the current Git-visible changes. Both
show real progress, verify the destination branch, and only then retarget
`origin`; the original source remains available as `upstream` when the
repository did not already have one.

The final review names the destination, mode, privacy, and remote change. Two
independent confirmations plus the full-range authorization slider are
required. If provider creation or publication succeeds but local retargeting
fails, the dialog says that the destination may already exist and leaves the
old remote in place when possible. See the [repository transfer feature
article](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/blob/main/docs/features/repository-management/repository-transfer.md)
for recovery, security, and verification details.

## App-hosted browser

> **Published source acceptance:** combined tests, verifier contracts, full
> TypeScript, the exact Windows production build, and hidden-desktop
> interaction/privacy checks pass. The source and accepted capture are pushed
> through `2abccae8fd`, and Pages/wiki publication is verified live. Packaged
> Windows E2E is verified. Installer/Release evidence remained pending at that
> dated checkpoint; archived TUI compatibility work does not block this
> Windows feature.

Open **Settings → Advanced → Open web links** and choose:

- **In the system browser** for the default, recommended behavior, especially
  when the app-hosted browser renders a blank page; or
- **Inside Desktop Material** to intentionally send browser-bound HTTP(S)
  links to the dedicated app-hosted window.

The selection persists, follows profile settings restore, and applies to later
links. An explicitly saved internal-browser choice remains selected.
Authentication is marked explicitly by the app; Desktop Material does not
guess from a hostname or URL path.

If Windows rejects an HTTP(S) launch, Desktop Material shows one non-blocking,
detail-free notice whether the link came from app content, the native Help
menu, or the app-hosted browser's external escape. It never includes the failed
URL and never silently falls back to the app-hosted browser.

The app-hosted window provides browser tabs, New tab, close, Back, Forward,
Refresh/Stop, a labelled address field, Go, ordinary bookmarks, and **Open
externally**. A bare host such as `example.com/docs` becomes HTTPS. Arbitrary
words are not sent to a search engine. HTTP(S) redirects stay in the current
tab; a page's `window.open` target is captured into a new app-hosted tab instead
of receiving an unrestricted popup. Use the toolbar search button or
Ctrl+F to search the active page. Plain text is the default
and highlights through Chromium; regex is an explicit opt-in with the shared
regex builder, case matching, previous/next navigation, and bounded context
results. Regex reads capped page text in an isolated world and does not mutate
remote page DOM, so it reports matches without pretending to highlight them.

Sign-in tabs show a **SIGN IN** marker and private-session notice. They cannot
be bookmarked, use an in-memory session shared only with their sign-in popups,
clear its storage/cache after the authentication browser closes, and always
offer **Continue in system browser**. A valid Desktop Material callback returns
to the app. Ordinary bookmarks persist, but their query strings and fragments
are removed first so OAuth codes and signed parameters do not land in bookmark
storage. Open tabs and their current URLs are not restored.

Remote pages are not part of the trusted Desktop Material renderer. Each lives
in a sandboxed `WebContentsView` with Node and preload disabled, context
isolation and web security enabled, permissions denied, downloads blocked, and
certificate failures refused. A blocked download explains that the page must
be opened externally. Load, certificate, download, and renderer failures appear
in the browser chrome with a refresh or external-browser recovery path.

## Local Ollama model management

Open **Settings → Copilot → Providers**, choose **Add provider…**, select
**Ollama (local)**, and save the preset. Its default URL is
`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`; Ollama runs locally without an API key. Choose
**Manage models** on the saved provider to open the lifecycle workspace.

The manager keeps service discovery, inventory, and mutations explicit:

1. Check the endpoint health and Ollama version. Installed and running models
   load independently, so a partial response does not erase usable data.
2. Search all installed models or filter to running models. While a query is
   present, **Clear search** removes it without changing the selected filter
   mode or case-sensitivity setting. Select one to inspect bounded size,
   digest, family, format, parameter, quantization,
   capability, license, and runtime details when Ollama reports them.
3. Pull a model by name and follow streamed progress; cancel only that pull if
   needed. Copy a model, or rename it through copy-then-delete with a visible
   partial result if the original cannot be removed.
4. Load or unload the selected model. Delete requires inline confirmation that
   names the exact model and warns that the action cannot be undone.

After an inventory-changing operation, Desktop Material synchronizes the
installed Ollama names back to that provider's selectable Copilot models. The
installed inventory is authoritative, while settings for still-matching model
identifiers are retained. A successful Ollama request followed by a failed
provider-settings update is reported as a split outcome rather than a complete
success.

Only HTTP or HTTPS loopback endpoints (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]`)
are accepted. The saved provider path must be exactly `/v1`; the manager derives
that loopback origin and appends only fixed native `/api/*` routes. Every remote
host, arbitrary prefix, saved `/api` base, embedded credential, query string,
and URL fragment is rejected. Stale requests are aborted when the provider
changes, response text stays bounded, and credentials are never added to
management URLs or logs.

Every label, validation message, progress announcement, confirmation, and
accessible name follows the selected **English**, playful **Hong Kong
Cantonese**, or **English / 香港粵語** mode. The manager is keyboard reachable
and reflows for compact Preferences windows.

The accepted 1452×1001 off-screen scene exercised health, inventory, search,
running-state filtering, pull cancellation and rollback, completed pull, copy,
rename, load, unload, confirmed deletion, and provider synchronization. It uses
synthetic fixture data, passes privacy inspection, and has no overlapping or
horizontally overflowing manager controls.

## Repository tabs

The workspace is **browser-like and tabbed**. Each tab is **bound to a repository and an account**,
so a tab always opens in the identity that owns it.

### Open a tab

- Click **+** on the tab strip to open a new tab, then pick a repository, **or**
- Middle-click / use the context menu on a repository in the list to open it in a new tab, **or**
- Drag one or more local repository folders onto the app. An existing repository switches instantly;
  a new valid repository is added and opened as a tab.

Tabs persist per account — reopening the app restores that account's tabs.

### Auto-detect repositories in a folder

Open **File → Add local repository…** and choose **Auto-detect repositories…**. Pick a parent
folder rather than one repository. Desktop Material performs a bounded scan that does not follow
symbolic links or junctions, skips generated/dependency folders, and stops descending when it finds
a repository. Review the relative paths in the result, then add all discovered repositories in one
step. You can still edit the path and use the normal single-repository flow at any time.

### Rename a tab

Double-click a tab's title (or use its context menu → **Rename**) to edit the label **inline**. The
rename is local to the tab and does not touch the repository name on disk or on the remote.

### Style a tab's title

Open a tab's context menu → **Text style** to open the styling popover. Per tab
you can set:

- **Weight** — bold on/off
- **Italic** and **underline**
- **Size**
- **Text color** — choose from the palette or use a custom color
- **Background color** — choose independently from the same palette or use a custom color
- **Font family**
- **Alignment**

The picker keeps a short recent-colors row for reuse. Styling is per tab, so you can give a
production repository a strong background while leaving a scratch repository muted and italic to
tell them apart at a glance.

> Tab layout and styling are part of your per-account settings, so every change **auto-commits** to
> that account's local settings repo. Open **Edit → Settings History…** or press `Ctrl+Alt+Z` if
> you ever need to inspect, undo, redo, or restore an earlier state.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Word-style tab appearance editor with typography, alignment, and independent text and background palettes.*

### Group tabs

Right-click any repository tab and choose **Add tab to new group…** to name a
group and choose one of six curated colors. The group appears as a visible chip
before its first member, with its name, member count, color, active state, and a
chevron. Select the chip—or focus it and press Enter/Space—to collapse its real
member tabs and select it again to restore them.

The same tab menu moves a tab into an existing group, removes it, expands or
collapses the group, or deletes only the organizational label. Deleting a group
never closes its repositories. Groups stay contiguous and cannot cross the
protected pinned/unpinned boundary; pin or unpin the tab before moving it to a
group on the other side. Names, membership, colors, collapse state, and future
compatible metadata persist per profile/window across open, close, bulk-close,
reload, history restore, and session import. All group copy and announcements
follow English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, or bilingual mode.

Dragging or using a named move action within a group's run keeps membership;
moving a member outside the run ungroups only that tab. One-shot label,
opened-time, status, and favorite arrangements keep every named group together
as a stable block.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Restart-restored named tab-group chip with its visible repository member.*

### Close matching tabs safely

The tab-strip menu keeps both directions explicit:

- **Close Tabs Containing…** uses the existing regular-expression workflow to close matching tabs.
- **Close all tabs except those containing…** keeps tabs whose visible label, repository alias/name,
  or local path contains a case-insensitive literal query. Review the live kept, closed, and pinned
  counts plus the bounded preview before confirming. Empty input and a query with zero matches
  cannot confirm, so this action cannot accidentally become close-all.

Pinned tabs are protected in both bulk-close directions. Unpin one explicitly before including it
in a bulk close.

### Pin and arrange tabs

Use the star control or context menu to mark a tab as a **Favorite**, and use **Pin tab** when it
must remain in the leading group. Open
**Arrange tabs** to:

- drag a tab within its current pin group;
- use the named **Move left**, **Move right**, **Move first**, and **Move last** keyboard actions;
- apply one-shot **A to Z**, **Z to A**, **Newest opened**, **Oldest opened**,
  **Needs attention first**, **Clean first**, **Favorites first**, or **Favorites last** ordering.

Each sort is a one-time edit: later repository-status changes do not reshuffle the strip. The saved
order remains manually editable and restores with the account/window tab state. Pin or unpin a tab
explicitly before moving it across the group boundary.

Use the strip's **Search tabs** button to find and switch to an open repository by its visible name,
alias, local path, or clone URL. **Arrange tabs** has a separate **Filter tabs** field for narrowing
the manual-order rows; the one-shot sort buttons still apply to every open tab and say so explicitly.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Arrange tabs surface with pinned and manual movement controls plus one-shot label, opened-date, and repository-status sorts.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Runtime repository-tab search matching an active repository by name and path.*

### Export or import the current tabs

Choose **File → Export current tabs…** to save a portable JSON description of the open tab order,
active tab, aliases, pins, favorites, and per-tab appearance. The file includes local repository
paths but never account tokens or credentials. Profile-local group definitions
and each tab's `groupId` are intentionally omitted, because membership without
its destination profile's definition would dangle. Choose **File → Import
current tabs…** to validate a file, preview it, then replace the current tabs or
merge with them; missing folders are skipped without destructively clearing a
usable current session, and the destination profile's existing groups remain
intact.

---

## Command palette

Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` to search every named app function. The palette covers the
whole app (Material 3's full-screen search view): results on the left, a
detail pane on the right naming what the highlighted command does and **where
it lives**, and a footer with the match count and keyboard hints. Each
comfortable row shows a leading Material Symbol, localized title, a compact
home label ("Toolbar", "Settings › Appearance"), optional search-term line,
and a localized Navigate, Repository, Branch, Changes, Edit, or App chip.
Compact density fits more commands by suppressing the secondary line.

Rows that are settings carry their live control inline — a switch for a
boolean, a text box for free text, a numeric box for a bounded number, a
select for a choice — so the value can be read and changed without leaving
the palette. Clicking any row (or pressing `Enter`) **teleports** to the
control that owns the feature: the owning surface opens, the control scrolls
into view, gets a brief spotlight ring, and receives focus. `Ctrl+Enter` or
the row's **Run** button executes the command instead; destructive and
network commands (push, force push, discard…) never fire from a teleport.

Use **Customize appearance** beside the filter and regex controls to choose
comfortable or compact rows and independently show/hide icons, group chips,
and the keyword line. The compact, left-aligned editor also offers **Random per
repository**: each repository gets one stable derived layout that survives
restarts instead of reshuffling every time the palette opens. Manual controls
remain visible but disabled while that mode is active. Changes apply
immediately and persist for later palette sessions; malformed stored values
repair field by field. Escape closes only the anchored appearance editor and
returns focus to its toggle, leaving the palette open.

The palette shell, groups, appearance controls, accessibility names, and the
Ollama model manager, Copilot/provider preferences, and background queue entries
follow English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, or bilingual mode. English
fallback titles and localized group names both remain searchable.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Full-app command palette showing matched commands with their live settings controls beside the compact aligned row appearance editor.*

## Appearance customization

### Ordinary preferences and visual owners

**Settings → Appearance** contains ordinary preferences only: explicit English, Hong Kong
Cantonese, or bilingual language mode; theme and scale; repository-list behavior; branch sorting;
formatting; and diff tab size. Visual customization belongs to the thing being changed.

`Shift`+right-click an actual element—or focus it and press the Context Menu key or
`Shift+F10`—to open its editor beside that owner. Supported owners include the app
identity/workspace, update progress bar, toolbar, repository list, repository tab strip,
code/diff surface, each reviewed Material feature entry point, each repository name and logo,
each tab title, and the temporary-submodule Back control. Ordinary right-click remains available
to the native or component-specific Git context menu.

Each owner has one strict `setting.json` in its own local Git repository. The anchored editor shows
and copies that exact path and opens the owner's **History** manager. Undo, redo, and restore append
audit commits; they never reset or rewrite a successful timeline. Switching profiles switches the
profile, feature, repository-element, and tab-element repository roots and closes stale editors.

Rapid slider, palette, and typography events are collapsed into the latest normalized owner value
before one durable write and state update. A queued `get()` read, explicit flush, or History action
remains an ordering barrier, and separately awaited changes keep their original sequence.

### Scheduled language and appearance

**Settings → Appearance → Scheduled settings** adds local-time rules for the
language mode, theme, and appearance values. Use the native date picker for
optional date bounds, the native time picker for an exclusive end time, and
either selected weekdays or **Every day** when only the time window matters.
Equal start and end times mean the selected day in full; a window that crosses
midnight continues into the following local day. Later active rules win only
for fields they set.

The source can be a local value, a versioned HTTPS API document, or a Home
Assistant boolean entity. API responses are bounded and allowlisted. A Home
Assistant value is used only while the configured entity reports `on`; its
access token is stored by the main process in the operating-system credential
vault, never in the schedule export or profile JSON. Offline, invalid, and
failed sources are skipped so the normal profile appearance remains usable.

See the detailed [scheduled settings feature article](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.17e76ca1604d01a0)
for the response shape, persistence boundary, security limits, and
verification contract.

The app identity editor covers the code-native logo and in-app name, geometry, color, typography,
spacing, emphasis, and effects. It does not rename the signed executable or operating-system icon.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Profile-customized app identity restored in the Material workspace.*

### Repository, logo, and tab owners

`Shift`+right-click the selected repository workspace, toolbar, or tab-strip background for its
repository-specific values and an **Edit profile default** route. `Shift`+right-click the actual
repository-list name for Word-style typography or its actual logo for the safe vector studio. You
can also focus an owner and press the Context Menu key or `Shift+F10`. A repository can inherit the
profile owner; **Edit profile default** keeps that profile editor anchored beside the same real
logo.

If you would rather find everything in one place, **Repository settings → Appearance** lists the
same five repository owners — list name, logo, tabs, toolbar, and workspace colors — using the very
same editors. It is a hub, not a second copy: each section says whether the value is inherited or
repository-owned, shows a live preview, offers **Reset to default** for that one owner, and commits
straight to the owner's own local Git repository, so the History, undo, and restore you see there
are the same ones the anchored editor shows. The hub never changes a profile default; for that,
`Shift`+right-click the element itself, use its keyboard gesture, or use Settings.

The toolbar editor includes text color, curated font family, 10–20 px title size, bold, italic,
underline, strikethrough, small caps, case, character spacing, text effects, alignment, and a live
toolbar preview. Profile controls can return to the Material theme. A repository stores only the
properties it changes, so individual controls can inherit the profile or **Inherit profile** can
clear the complete local typography layer.

A local `desktop-material.appearance-id` UUID identifies the working copy across path moves. Each
workspace, toolbar, tabs, list-name, and logo value still owns a separate local Git repository. The
old aggregate `desktop-material.appearance` payload is read only as a migration/startup compatibility
source, not as the mutable history.

The vector logo workbench provides:

- Start from the repository-mark, monogram, or repository-name preset and watch the live preview.
- Choose a rounded square, circle, square, or hexagon; use a solid or gradient fill; then tune
  colors, gradient angle, border, and shadow.
- Compose up to eight mark and text layers. Reorder or remove layers and edit their mark/text
  source, font, weight, letter spacing, color, position, scale, rotation, and opacity.
- Use **Undo** and **Redo** while experimenting. A repository override can return to **Inherit
  profile logo** without changing the profile design.
- **Export JSON…** for a portable design and bounded version-1 **Import JSON…**.

Logo JSON is capped at 16 KiB, text and layer counts are bounded, and every value is normalized to
the supported model. The studio never stores uploaded image bytes, HTML, or executable/raw SVG.
Tabs and repository-list rows render only the app's code-generated SVG projection.
`Shift`+right-click an actual tab title, use its keyboard context-menu gesture, or choose the tab
command menu's **Customize Appearance…** action for its own typography/color editor, dedicated
repository, and history; structural tab state remains separate. Desktop Material initializes the
clicked title before opening its editor. If an account/profile transition is still rebuilding that
title owner, the editor stays closed and a localized status asks you to try again instead of taking
down the app window.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Layered custom repository-logo studio with a live preview and safe vector controls.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Appearance editor anchored beside its actual owner with History, a dedicated local Git path, and burst-safe persistence.*

---

## Settings history

Desktop Material records ordinary per-account preferences and structural tab state in the account
settings repository. Open **Edit → Settings History…** or press `Ctrl+Alt+Z` for that non-modal
timeline. Visual owners deliberately do not share it: use the **History** action in an anchored
appearance editor for that element's narrower Git repository.

- Select a timeline entry to lazily load its changed files and diff.
- Choose **Undo last** to reverse the latest logical change, or **Redo** to replay an undone change.
- Use an entry's restore action to confirm and restore the complete settings state at that point.
- Choose **Load more** when the timeline contains more entries than the first page.
- Undo, redo, and restore all append audit commits, so the history itself is never rewritten.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Live Settings history side sheet.*

---

## Non-modal dialogs

Desktop Material's dialogs are **non-modal floating surfaces** — the main window stays fully
interactive while a dialog is open.

- **Drag a dialog by its header** to reposition it, and keep working in the app behind it.
- **Click or focus a dialog to bring it to front**; multiple open dialogs **cascade** so you can see
  them all.
- **Wheel or trackpad-scroll anywhere over dialog content**; nested lists and editors consume their
  own range first, then the outer dialog continues at the nested edge.
- OS-native pickers (file open/save) stay native.

**Preferences** is the reference surface: an MD3 940×660 dialog with browser-style horizontal tabs,
an **Active** chip on the current section, and a pill footer. The same shared tab surface is used by
**Repository settings** and **Stash Manager**, so opening a new page, closing a page, finding overflow,
and moving with `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, or `End` behaves consistently across all three dialogs. The
open-page session is local to each surface; filtering the strip does not close hidden pages, and stale
stored page IDs are discarded safely. The **repository** and **branch** pickers
open as MD3 **side sheets** rather than blocking modals. The repository sheet keeps **Add** and
**Select** visible, while **More** holds group creation, workspace sync, and commit/push-all so
all five actions stay available without wrapping into a cluttered multi-line block. Its
**Filters** disclosure folds account, service, status, search, and regex controls together;
active values remain applied and are counted on the pill while the panel is collapsed.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Global Settings as an MD3 dialog with browser-style tabs, close actions, search, and overflow.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Repository Settings with the shared browser-style tabs and Remote page selected.*

The Settings and Repository Settings tab rails are dockable from the visible **Settings tab
position** control. Choose **Left**, **Top**, **Bottom**, or **Right**; left is the default, and
Preferences and Repository Settings remember their choices separately. Top and bottom use a
horizontal scrollable strip, while left and right keep the vertical strip and its matching arrow
keys. Invalid or missing local values safely return to the left rail. See the detailed
[settings tab docking article](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.71a7d2433aa53088) for
the storage keys and verification contract.

# Power workflows

## Multi-clone

The multi-clone window clones **many repositories in one pass**.

1. Open **Clone → Multiple repositories** (or the multi-clone entry in the repositories menu).
2. The list shows every repository available to the active account. Use the **search bar** — with
   filter chips, regex mode, and the regex builder (see the Regex Guide) — to narrow
   it down.
3. Use **org filter chips** to limit the list to a specific organization.
4. **Tick the checkboxes** for the repositories you want.
5. Choose the clone mode:
   - **Parallel** — clone all selected repos at once (fast; heavier on network/disk).
   - **One-by-one** — clone sequentially (gentler; easier to watch progress and spot failures).
6. Start the clone. Progress is shown per repository.

### Optional post-clone Actions runner

For one selected **private** GitHub or GitHub Enterprise repository, expand
**Runner provisioning** before cloning, opt in, confirm that its workflow
authors are trusted, and choose **Windows** or **Linux via WSL**. Desktop
Material completes the clone first, then creates a repository-scoped runner
without an elevated prompt. Public repositories, multi-clone queues, and
background auto-clones cannot create runners. A setup failure leaves the clone
available and directs you to the repository's **Actions** tab for recovery.

Because a runner executes workflow code as your Windows user, remove it from
the Actions tab before changing its repository to public. The app rechecks
privacy before setup and before a stopped runner can restart.

Changing the account clears repository selections from the previous identity before loading the new
account's list. If a provider refresh fails, use **Try again** in the same view; a stale repository
cannot remain selected for cloning under the replacement account.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Safe RE2 builder with bounded live matching and capture previews.*

On a compact or zoomed viewport, the builder stacks its category and building-block areas before
cards clip. Its body scrolls vertically while the live tester and footer actions remain reachable;
the dialog does not require page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Export / import repo lists

- **Export** writes the selected repositories to a list file containing **portable clone URLs only**
  — no tokens, credentials, local paths, query strings, or fragments.
- **Import** loads such a list back into the checkbox selection, so you can re-clone the same set on
  another machine or share a curated set with a teammate.
- Import rejects local paths and `file:` URLs before any clone starts; the list is a clone recipe,
  not a local filesystem instruction.
- After each imported clone finishes, Desktop Material runs the same Cheap LFS
  large-file restoration used by the normal clone path when **Repository
  settings → Cheap LFS → Download large files after cloning** is enabled (the
  default). The transfer file does not export account bindings or a
  manifest-bound file selection; those remain local so a shared list cannot
  carry credentials or stale restore proofs. If the setting is off or no
  eligible provider account is available, pointer files remain intact for a
  later restore.

### Background auto-clone

Open **Settings → Clone queue** to manage the policy after the Clone dialog closes. Each signed-in
hosted account has its own card: choose an absolute base directory, select **Parallel — up to 3 at
once** or **Sequential — one at a time**, then enable **Automatically clone new repositories**. The
GitHub clone view can configure the same policy. Desktop Material records the current provider list
as a baseline; it does not immediately clone every existing repository. Repositories discovered after
that baseline are queued into the chosen directory in the background.

Discovery continues for the app lifetime after the Clone window closes. It refreshes periodically,
does not open a progress dialog on its own, and posts a notification when a background queue starts
or when refresh needs attention. The policy is account-specific and rejects invalid directories,
oversized provider lists, duplicate/unsafe URLs, and URLs containing embedded credentials.
Changing the directory or clone mode while the switch is on updates that account immediately.
Turning it off stops new automatic batches without cancelling a clone that is already running.

### Pause, resume, and crash recovery

The batch progress surface can be hidden while cloning continues. Choose **Pause remaining** to stop
new queue items from starting; clones already running finish, and **Resume** safely continues the
pending work. **Cancel remaining** marks work that has not started as skipped, while **Retry failed**
starts only failed items again.

Queue transitions are durably journaled. If the renderer or app closes during a clone, the next
launch restores the queue in a paused state and labels formerly running rows **interrupted**. Resume
then inspects each destination before invoking Git again:

- an empty destination can be retried;
- a clean, non-bare worktree with a valid `HEAD` and the exact matching `origin` is accepted as the
  completed clone; and
- an occupied, incomplete, linked, bare, tracked-modified, or differently bound destination is left
  untouched and marked for review.

Recovery never deletes or moves destination contents. The bounded journal stores queue metadata and
stable account references, never provider tokens or credential-bearing clone URLs.

## Guided Git and GitHub functions

Desktop Material turns useful Git, GitHub CLI, and GitHub API capabilities into **named,
task-specific workflows**. You choose an action, complete a focused form, review any destructive
or worktree-changing step, and receive the result in the app. Expert API integration is kept in the
separate repository-contextual Explorer below; it does not turn the guided Git workflows into a raw
command console.

### GitHub API Explorer

Open **API** in the repository rail, or **Repository tools → API functions**, to work against the
GitHub host and account explicitly bound to the selected repository. The Explorer never falls back
to another identity on the same host. Eligible repositories receive a small set of safe read
functions automatically, and each appears as a runnable button.

Choose **Hide API tab** to remove the rail item for this repository. **Show API tab** in the API
functions tool restores it. The full REST/GraphQL operation catalog and manual request builder are
available only after choosing **Add or edit an API function**.

- Search the complete current catalog of **1,206 REST operations** by method, path, summary, or
  operation ID, narrow it by category, or choose the **New operations** scope to see exactly the
  **10 operations added since the prior pinned 2026-03-10 catalog**.
- Select a catalog result to populate its method and repository-aware path, or switch between the
  **REST** and **GraphQL** request builders for an explicit request.
- Read requests can run directly. REST write methods and GraphQL mutations first show a
  **Review GitHub API mutation** step with the exact account and request preview; they run only
  after **Run reviewed request** is confirmed.
- The response view exposes status and allowlisted diagnostic headers, bounds and truncates the
  displayed body, and recursively redacts credential-shaped values before rendering them.

#### Save API requests as app functions

The **App functions** panel turns a validated REST catalog request or named GraphQL operation into a
reusable extension of Desktop Material. Enter a lowercase function name and description, then choose
**Add current request as function**. Each saved function includes a generated argument schema and
can be run, edited from the current request, or removed in the same panel.

Functions follow the active profile and appear only for the exact repository, remote, GitHub host,
and account binding used when they were created. Read functions can run from the panel or through
the local Agent API as `github_api_<function-name>` tools. A write or destructive function must run
through the API tab's visible mutation-review flow; an agent cannot bypass that confirmation.
Credentials are neither accepted in a function template nor stored with one.

### Shallow clone

Open **File → Clone repository… → URL** when you need only recent history:

1. Enter the repository URL and local path.
2. Enable **Shallow clone**.
3. Set **Commit depth** to the number of commits to fetch.
4. Review the summary, then choose **Clone**.

The form explains that it fetches the current branch and recursive submodules. If you need older
history later, use the named deepen-history action in **Repository tools**.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Shallow clone with a commit-depth control.*

### Deepen shallow history

Open the **Tools** rail, find **History depth**, and choose **Check history status**. When Git reports
a shallow boundary, choose **Review bounded deepen** to fetch a specific number of older commits or
**Review full history** to remove the boundary deliberately. The review names the selected remote,
scope, and consequence before the bundled Git runtime starts. Progress is cancellable, and the app
rechecks the marker when the fetch completes.

The production fixture began with 3 visible commits and finished with all 15; the clean screenshot
below shows the final state. The raw verification receipt is retained in the P0 run manifest.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Repository Tools showing full history after a verified deepen.*

Repository Tools owns its vertical scroll region. At normal, minimum, short-height, and 150% zoom
layouts, scrolling reaches the exact final results surface without moving the whole document or
clipping controls below the viewport.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Short Repository Tools workspace scrolled to its reachable final results surface.*

### Sparse checkout

Open **Repository → Manage sparse checkout…** to keep selected directories in a large worktree.
The side panel reports whether sparse checkout is enabled and guides each change through
**Choose/Adjust/Restore → Review selection → Apply and refresh**:

1. **Choose/Adjust/Restore** one repository-relative directory root per line. Slashes are normalized, while
   absolute paths, traversal, option-like input, control characters, blanks, duplicates, and
   over-limit selections are rejected. State-aware guidance says whether the selection is empty,
   needs correction, or is ready for review.
2. **Review selection** freezes the normalized input before Git changes the worktree. The bounded review
   shows every selected root. When cone mode is already enabled, it also reports added, removed,
   and unchanged selection entries; these counts describe directory-root entries rather than
   predicting individual local files.
3. **Apply and refresh** the reviewed operation. Cancellation
   remains available while Git is changing the worktree. Success, cancellation, or failure stays
   on the result phase until you edit the selection or request a manual refresh.

The three-step guide remains visible above the scrolling editor and review body. On a compact
window, its steps stack inside the sheet instead of covering content or forcing sideways scrolling.

Choose **Review enable** only after the valid-directory count and exact normalized review match
your intent. Reapply and disable have their own review confirmations; disabling restores the full
tracked working tree without changing commits or history. The verified disabled state below leaves
all working-tree paths eligible to appear locally.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Guided sparse-checkout sheet with Review active, the editor locked, and the exact normalized docs selection.*

These forms wrap labels and stack actions as space narrows. Page-level sideways scrolling is not
part of the workflow; only inherently spatial content such as code, diffs, and logs may scroll
horizontally when preserving columns is necessary.

### Preview an ordinary pull

Right-click the primary **Pull _remote_** button in the toolbar, or choose
**Pull** from the application menu, when the current branch has incoming work.
A plain left click on the toolbar button pulls immediately without opening the
review. For the reviewed path, Desktop Material
fetches the configured remote first; if that fetch fails, the review stops
instead of displaying an older remote-tracking ref as fresh data.

The review identifies the local and upstream branches and their captured object
IDs, shows ahead/behind counts and the effective fast-forward, merge, rebase,
merge-preserving rebase, interactive-rebase, or blocked fast-forward-only
route, and lists up to 25 incoming commits and 100 incoming changed files. The
file list describes the upstream side from the merge base, so local-only files
do not appear as incoming. Overflow counts keep larger pulls explicit.

The initial fetch has no safe cancellation path, so the modal cannot be closed
with a button, Escape, or the backdrop while loading. **Cancel** appears after
preparation finishes and dismisses only the displayed review.

**Pull reviewed commit** is available only for a completely clean worktree.
After confirmation, Desktop Material refreshes state and revalidates the local
branch, upstream ref, and both full OIDs. It integrates the exact reviewed
upstream OID already fetched, without a second network fetch; if either side
changed, the stale review is cleared until **Refresh preview** succeeds. The
modal review remains open while Git starts and runs, preventing an in-app
branch switch from changing the reviewed pull destination.

The sheet follows English, playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, or bilingual
language mode. It applies to ordinary manual pull actions only. Scheduled
**Automatically pull** runs and explicitly noninteractive local-agent pull
commands keep their direct automation paths and safety checks, while Pull All
and batch sync retain their own review and result surfaces.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Reviewed ordinary Git pull with exact branch identities, incoming commits, changed files, and a clean-worktree confirmation gate.*

### Rebase the current branch

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Commit checkpoints moving in order onto a newer main-line history.*

Open **Branch → Rebase current branch…**, then search for and select the target/base branch. The
review shows the current→target relationship, ahead/behind context, and a bounded preview of commits
that would be replayed.

Before Git starts, Desktop Material refreshes repository state and blocks unresolved conflicts,
dirty changes, and another ongoing operation. It also revalidates the exact current and target refs,
so a stale branch picker cannot launch a different rebase. You can cancel while that preflight is
running. If Git reports conflicts after start, resolve them through the existing continue/abort
flow. Protected branches receive explicit guidance, and the app never force-pushes automatically;
review any later force-with-lease decision separately.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Reviewed current-branch rebase showing current to target, ahead and behind counts, and a bounded commit preview.*

### Create a pull request

Open **Branch → Create pull request** while the head branch is checked out:

1. Confirm the exact target repository and signed-in account.
2. Choose the base branch; the current local branch is the fixed head.
3. Enter a title and optional Markdown description, and choose whether to create a draft.
4. Select **Review pull request** and verify repository, account, base/head, title, body, and draft
   state.
5. Select **Create pull request**. The success receipt offers **Done** and **Open on GitHub**.

The app rejects ambiguous remote syntax and routes account problems to repository settings. The
workflow does not expose `gh pr create`, editable arguments, or a raw REST request.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Native pull-request creation success with wrapped content.*

### Inspect effective branch rules

Open **Repository → Inspect branch rules…**. The non-modal sheet combines classic protection and
rulesets for the checked-out branch into plain-language sections for reviews, checks, deployments,
merge queue, verified signatures, linear history, update/delete/force policy, bypass context, and
source rulesets. Use **Refresh** to load the same exact branch again.

If no matching account is signed in, **Open account settings** is shown. If more than one account
matches a legacy repository, **Open repository settings** opens the real repository-account picker;
saving one records its stable `endpoint#id` identity. Unknown or partial policy evidence is stated
instead of guessed.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Effective branch rules with long checks and policy details wrapped.*

## One-click commit & push

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: A short-lived feature branch passing review and merging into the stable line.*

For quick, low-ceremony commits, use **one-click commit & push**:

1. Stage the changes you want (or commit everything shown in **Changes**).
2. Press the **one-click commit & push** action.
3. **Copilot writes the commit message** from your staged diff.
4. Desktop Material commits and pushes in one guided operation. A large
   ordinary selection can produce several proven commit/push batches.

This is a convenience path built on the normal commit machinery — you can always fall back to
writing the message yourself in the **Changes** view. For scheduled, unattended commits and pushes,
see Automation.

When many ordinary small files approach a **decimal 1.5 GB
(1,500,000,000-byte) push**, even the normal Commit action automatically becomes
a commit-and-push sequence. Desktop Material uses a conservative 1.4 GB
changed-blob budget, reserves the rest for Git/path overhead, and separately
bounds path count and proof output. It keeps stable file order, commits only the
next group, records a durable pending ref, performs a normal fast-forward push,
proves that exact commit at the remote tip, and only then creates the next
commit. A failed or unproven push stops before another local commit exists;
after fixing the remote or authentication issue, retry Commit or Push and the
pending batch is finished first. This is an app safety policy rather than a
claimed universal Git-host pack-size limit.

Push also checks unpushed history made by an older Desktop Material. Safe
existing commits keep their IDs, authors, timestamps, messages, and signatures,
and are pushed and proven one at a time before new working-tree batches begin.
An already pending current batch resumes without entering that rewriter. An
individually oversized commit can be rebuilt
automatically only on a linear, clean,
local-only branch with an exact configured or resolved destination and no
operation in progress. A
compare-and-swap backup
ref protects the original tip; Desktop Material never force-pushes or rolls
back a batch already proven remote. Rebuilt oversized history preserves the
reviewed message and final tree, but has new commit IDs, does not preserve
cryptographic commit signatures, and does not promise the original author
timestamp on each replacement batch. Desktop Material proves the final tree and
every replacement path's mode/object ID. Commit commands
disable automatic Git packing only for that process with `-c gc.auto=0`. If Git
creates the exact verified commit and only later reports a maintenance failure,
the app keeps the commit and warns once instead of duplicating it.

When a selected file is larger than GitHub's ordinary 100 MiB object limit and
the configured **Cheap LFS** backend is available, every commit entry point
prepares it before invoking Git. The compact terminal below Commit reports up to
three sanitized worker rows, active and queued counts, hashing/preparation/upload/verification
phases, selected/recommended providers and the recommendation reason, per-file
and aggregate bytes, observed elapsed time, renderer-measured throughput and ETA,
honest manual-handoff phases, and success/failure counts. Long recommendations
use a native keyboard-focusable disclosure; 100% appears only after the provider
accepts and the app verifies the object. A setting under
**Repository settings → Build & Run** switches between sequential operation
and at most three transfers. A failed raw file stays selected for the next try,
while unrelated safe changes and successful pointers can commit. Use the
**Large files** Changes filter to isolate files over the same threshold.

Every failure says why. Each settled failure adds its own row to the terminal
naming the file and the reason — including the provider's HTTP status where
there is one — and the same reason is repeated in the "Some large files were
not pinned" notification, so a run can never end on a bare `pinned 0 · failed
10`. Provider text is trimmed and scrubbed of URLs and credentials before it is
shown.

On the **GitHub published prerelease** backend a release tag has to point at a
commit GitHub already has. If the current branch has never been pushed, Desktop
Material publishes that branch first and re-reads the remote to confirm it
landed, then uploads. If it genuinely cannot — no GitHub repository, no push
remote, a detached HEAD, or a branch with no commits yet — it stops before
uploading anything and names that exact reason on every affected file instead
of retrying. Publish the repository or branch, then commit again.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Changes sidebar with the Large files filter and a three-worker Cheap LFS terminal showing queue, provider, reason, timing, ETA, and manual controls.*

The same settings page chooses **GitHub published prerelease**, **GHCR · one
OCI image**, or **Docker Hub · one OCI image**. The terminal recommends
ordinary Git, Releases, GHCR, or Docker Hub from the selected byte total and
detected local setup without changing your choice. A configured credential does
not prove live quota, billing, organization policy, or service health. The Git
repository stores only the pointer; the original bytes live in Release assets
or registry layers.

Before committing a private registry pointer, Desktop Material proves its exact
tracked shared key. An unsafe selected path remains blocked unless a fresh,
repository-bound Git status proves that the exact Windows-hostile legacy path is
currently deleted. The exception is deletion-only: a current nondeleted unsafe
path, an absent or mismatched status proof, and a real OCI pointer under a
control-plane path all remain fail-closed.

Desktop Material first uses a bounded exact-length `gh api` upload when GitHub CLI exists in its
trusted Program Files location. This avoids opening Electron's native upload pipe, which can crash
the app if its remote data-pipe consumer closes during a write. The app
uses the selected account and host, streams and hashes only the validated file range, passes the
token through an isolated temporary child environment rather than the command line, and tears down
the CLI on cancel or app quit. Before uploading again, it scans all ten bounded Release pages once;
if an exact-name object exists, later checks poll only its ID. A completed exact-size/digest asset is
reused, while a persistent `starter` asset fails closed so it cannot be overwritten or mistaken for
success.

If the trusted CLI is unavailable, Desktop Material retains Electron's memory-bounded chunked
compatibility transport. Uploads on either transport run with no stall or runtime timeout — a slow
connection can take as long as it needs, and a transfer ends only on completion, a transport
failure, or your explicit Cancel; choose the manual flow below if it cannot complete.

For explicit recovery, choose **Manual upload** beside the progress controls. Desktop Material
stops that attempt and places all remaining files into one temporary **upload-these-files** folder.
Whole-file assets use verified same-volume hardlinks or bounded copies; the browser folder never
contains symlinks or zero-byte helpers. Files above the Release limit become ordered `.partNNN`
range copies made with a bounded buffer. Every staged file is rechecked as a regular file with its
exact expected size before Explorer opens it. The commit button shows live preparation
percentage while the app hashes and stages those bytes. It checks the temporary volume before the
worst-case handoff copy and reports insufficient space instead of filling the disk. It opens the exact selected
Release edit/upload page first, then puts that folder in front: select all prepared files, drag them
onto GitHub's asset drop zone, and let the browser finish the upload (then choose its save/update
action if shown). A retry verifies and reuses exact prior parts, starts progress with their completed
bytes, and stages only missing names; digest-less prior parts receive a bounded download/hash check.
Incomplete `starter` objects remain blocking and the Release editor can be used to wait for or delete
them. The app freshly fences every exact asset ID before pointer writes, rechecks every source, writes
the pointers, and resumes the same commit automatically. Older GitHub
Enterprise versions safely fall back to the repository Releases listing. **Cancel** stops either
path until the verified pointer commit begins; that short final mutation phase finishes as one
reviewed operation. The app waits for and verifies every multipart asset before writing the pointer.
A file fitting the 500 MiB new-write cap initially uses one raw asset, while a
larger file uses ordered raw ranges of at most 500 MiB each. Legacy pointers
with parts up to 2 GiB remain readable. Public repositories
then automatically receive one owned, SHA-pinned workflow file in Changes for
review. Compression starts only after you commit and push that caller. Private
repositories stay off until you explicitly enable **Cloud compression** in the
Large files manager or Repository Settings. That persisted opt-in installs no
workflow in the private repository and spends none of its Actions minutes;
compression is routed through the encrypted public builder, whose external
registration must be completed before it runs. Unknown visibility stays off.

The GitHub Action downloads and raw-DEFLATEs one Release object at a time, uses
no Actions artifacts or caches, and adopts a verified side asset only when it is
strictly smaller. A failed or non-beneficial object keeps its exact raw pointer
and asset, so it remains cloneable; other objects continue and a multipart
pointer may safely be mixed. Raw assets remain available for older commits.
GitHub Actions never decompresses. On clone, pull, user-requested fetch, open,
or **Materialize**, Desktop Material downloads compressed bytes and expands
them on your local PC under the pointer's exact output cap, then verifies every
original part and the complete file before replacing the pointer. To refresh an
older clone that still contains only pointer text, update Desktop Material and
reopen the repository with **Download large files after cloning** enabled, or
choose **Large files → Materialize all**. Explicitly public GitHub.com Release
pointers can restore while signed out using read-only anonymous requests with no
`Authorization` header. Private, unknown-visibility, and GitHub Enterprise
Release pointers still require the repository-selected account; anonymous
Release mutations are never allowed.

### Exact-90% two-lane restore progress

> **Published source acceptance:** combined tests, verifier contracts,
> TypeScript, the exact production build, and hidden-desktop acceptance pass.
> The source and accepted capture are pushed through `2abccae8fd`, and
> Pages/wiki publication is verified live. Packaged Windows E2E is verified.
> Installer/Release evidence remained pending at that dated checkpoint;
> archived TUI compatibility work does not block this Windows feature.

For Release-backed pointers, one restore batch now shares a coordinator with a
hard limit of two HTTP downloads. The current file or multipart part owns the
first lane. When the provider reports that transfer at **90% or greater**, the
next file or part may start in the look-ahead lane: 89.9% stays single-lane,
while exactly 90% opens it. If a provider has no usable progress total, the next
item waits for the current transfer to settle.

The detailed restore panel shows overall progress and separate **Current** and
**Next at 90%** lanes, plus repository, provider, current phase, file and part
ordinals, logical restored bytes, actual downloaded/compressed bytes when
known, succeeded/failed/remaining/queued counts, elapsed time, download rate,
ETA, bounded per-file failures, and cancellation. Downloading, decrypting,
decompressing, verifying, materializing, and canceling remain distinct instead
of sharing one ambiguous percentage. For an encrypted-and-compressed Release object, the
truthful transform order is **Downloading → Decrypting → Decompressing →
Verifying → Materializing**. Plain bilingual copy renders the second phase as
**Decrypting · 解密緊**; playfulness may change the voice but never the phase,
path, byte counts, or order.

The second lane does not weaken validation. Desktop Material still verifies
every part's size and SHA-256, assembles parts in pointer order, verifies the
whole file, and replaces only the unchanged pointer. Cancellation aborts queued
and active work, drains both lanes, cleans owned temporary files, and leaves
unverified pointers in place. Visible counters update exactly; screen-reader
announcements are grouped into meaningful 10% transitions, reduced-motion mode
removes active shimmer, and bilingual/narrow layouts wrap instead of clipping.

New buckets are published prereleases, so collaborators can fetch them while
they remain outside the stable installer `/releases/latest` feed. For
compatibility, older draft discovery is bounded to 100 pages of 100 releases
because GitHub's direct tag lookup does not expose drafts. Desktop Material
publishes a revalidated legacy draft before a new pin only when the exact
managed-bucket sentinel or a valid legacy asset label proves its Cheap LFS
provenance. The compression Action accepts only a published managed
prerelease; it refuses a draft, stable Release, or unrelated same-tag
prerelease before download or upload and leaves the raw pointer unchanged. The
same safe fallback applies when the Release has reached GitHub's 1,000-asset
capacity and therefore has no free slot for a compressed side asset. Cheap LFS
retains the raw historical object instead of deleting it to force compression.

Live public automatic and private explicit-opt-in runs each reduced the 1 MiB
acceptance object to a verified 1,033-byte side asset. Both compressed pointers
were restored manually through Desktop Material to the exact original SHA-256;
an earlier failed draft lookup also left its raw pointer materializable through
the same production UI.

### Live 14.8 GB Bambu build acceptance

The public `codingmachineedge/bambu-build` exercise used the real Changes and
Clone UI for exactly **8,305 payload files** and **14,809,588,162 bytes**.
Desktop Material created four ordered commit/push batches below its conservative
limit. The first ordinary push received HTTP 408 but kept the exact pending
commit durable; retry pushed that same immutable SHA before creating the next
batch.

Managed cloud run `30048474438` compressed each of the 13 Release objects one at
a time and reported **13 compressed, 0 kept raw, and 0 failed**. All 13 raw
originals remain beside the 13 compressed assets, so older pointers retain raw
fallback. The final real-UI manifest commit `712ad85` passed verifier run
`30054805137`, which checked all 8,305 files, ten pointers, and 26 assets and
published immutable manifest Release `bambu-build-verify-30054805137`.

A fresh real-UI clone restored all ten logical SHA-256 values while the Git
commit still held only 370–514-byte pointer blobs. Its first explicit
**Materialize all** overlapped clone/open automatic restoration and produced two
hash-identical compare-and-swap recovery copies. The bytes remained correct,
but Desktop Material now serializes automatic and manual materialization per
repository; `HANDOFF.md` records the corrected UI acceptance separately from
that initial integrity proof. Canceling **Materialize all** now cancels every
batch queued for that repository — including automatic restores enqueued by a
concurrent fetch or pull — so a canceled download cannot silently restart, the
panel reloads the pinned-file list after a cancel, and a batch that finishes
with failures reports how many files were left as pointers instead of claiming
unconditional success.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Live public Bambu build Cheap LFS inventory with ten tracked Release-backed pointer objects.*

Each Cheap LFS Release holds at most 1,000 assets. Desktop Material counts all
ten asset pages and uses `assets`, then `assets-2`, `assets-3`, and later buckets
as needed. A multipart file or one manual batch always stays together; if the
current bucket lacks enough slots, every asset in that group moves to the next
Release and its pointer stores the exact tag. Assets still marked `starter` by
GitHub reserve a slot but remain unavailable until GitHub reports them uploaded.
New asset buckets are published prereleases, so they cannot replace the stable
installer update feed.

### GHCR and Docker Hub image storage

Registry storage keeps the repository's complete current object set in one
logical `<source-name>-cheap-lfs` image. One stable tag identifies the newest
snapshot, but committed pointers always name an immutable manifest digest.
One current snapshot is explicitly bounded to 4,096 objects, 8,192 layers, and
8 MiB each for its canonical config and manifest JSON; a larger structural plan
fails before publish rather than pretending that "one image" is unbounded.
Adding or removing files cannot append to that digest: Desktop Material creates
a new manifest, reuses every unchanged content-addressed blob, uploads only new
layers, verifies the result, and moves the tag. Pointer-form files move to that
new digest; verified materialized raws stay in the working tree with their valid
older pointer metadata. Each digest also receives a deterministic
`desktop-material-cheap-lfs-sha256-<64hex>` retention tag before the stable tag
moves. Historical retention tags are not deleted, so older manifests remain
referenced for mixed current generations and older Git commits instead of
depending on a registry to preserve untagged data.

New layers start at 1.5 GiB. GHCR documents a 10 GB per-layer maximum and a
ten-minute upload timeout, so Desktop Material bounds each ORAS operation below
that deadline. A timed-out layer is not resumable or mutable; the app rebuilds
that object's layers at half the previous size, down to 8 MiB, and safely
re-encounters already accepted blobs by digest. Docker Hub publishes no general
hard layer-size or upload-time cap that Desktop Material can encode. Its current
plan, pull, storage, abuse, and fair-use limits still apply, and the app uses no
more than three concurrent transfers for either provider. Docker's current
[pull-rate table](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/pulls/) lists 100
pulls per six hours for unauthenticated users, 200 for authenticated Personal
users, and unlimited pulls for authenticated Pro, Team, and Business users,
subject to fair use.

For a verified-private source repository, every registry chunk is encrypted
with AES-256-GCM. Desktop Material intentionally commits the shared key at
`.desktop-material/cheap-lfs-registry-key-v1` so collaborators who can read the
private Git repository can decrypt the image. This protects against a registry-
only leak; it does **not** protect against anyone who can read the repository,
an old clone, fork, backup, or Git history. Do not make that history public or
discard an old key while immutable historical pointers still need it. New
private pointers bind their key with `key-id sha256:...`; Desktop Material
force-includes and proves the required tracked key even when an ignore rule or
selection checkbox would otherwise omit it.

GHCR publishing uses the selected GitHub.com account. Docker Hub publishing
uses the signed-in Docker Desktop credential helper; only a first publish
defaults to that account namespace. Later same-provider updates keep the exact
package already named by the pointers, including an organization/collaborator
namespace. Changing providers requires every old pointer to be an exact,
unedited materialized raw; the app re-hashes local bytes and publishes a fresh
full snapshot without pulling from or deleting the old provider. Tokens are
passed to the trusted bundled ORAS process through standard input, not command
arguments. Public images restore anonymously. Private images need the matching
provider credential and tracked key. A first public GHCR package
is refused before upload because GitHub creates it private and has no supported
visibility-change API; choose published Releases or Docker Hub, or first make
an existing exact-linked GHCR package public in GitHub package settings. A
first private GHCR push also waits for GitHub to report that exact source link;
if it does not, the app leaves the stable tag and pointers unchanged so you can
link the package in settings and retry. Its verified digest-specific retention
tag remains, allowing immutable blobs to be reused safely.

GitHub's [OAuth scope
reference](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)
says `write:packages` grants package upload and download, but its [Container
registry page](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)
separately says Packages supports PAT classic only. Desktop Material requests
and validates `write:packages`, and its selected OAuth token passed a non-
mutating GHCR challenge; no live package mutation was part of that acceptance.
A provider rejection therefore fails closed before the stable tag or pointers
move rather than claiming PAT-classic compatibility.

Windows installers ship the digest-pinned ORAS 1.3.2 executable and its verified
Apache-2.0 license. The ARM64 installer currently carries the same audited x64
ORAS binary as the x64 installer and depends on Windows 11 x64 emulation; if it
cannot start, registry storage fails closed and published Release storage
remains available.

The compatibility Electron path reads even a multi-gigabyte part incrementally
instead of retaining one in-process request body.

Open the repository rail's **Large files** destination to manage the pointers
directly. It lists and searches original repository-relative paths, pins
reviewed files, and materializes one or all pointer files without requiring you
to find their backing assets in GitHub Releases or a registry. Each row
identifies published Release, GHCR, or Docker Hub storage. Release rows also
show **Raw**, **Compressed**, or **Mixed** and the public/private cloud policy.
OCI rows offer **Remove from image**, which publishes a survivor-only snapshot
and updates the other pointers before the path is removed. The managed Release
workflow is added to Changes for your review rather than committed silently.
Materialize all reuses one paginated inventory per Release instead of repeating
the same API pages for every pointer. Choose **Open Cheap LFS settings** to jump
straight to **Repository settings → Cheap LFS**, the dedicated tab (right after
**Build & run**) that holds the storage provider, auto-pin, auto-download,
parallel-upload, and cloud-compression preferences. The Large files page owns the
repository view's vertical scroll, so every row and action in a long inventory
remains reachable without a competing nested page scroll.

The prepared folder is flat because GitHub Release assets cannot contain subfolders. Cheap LFS still
remembers every original repository-relative path: files in nested folders return to those exact
paths, and duplicate basenames receive distinct hash-suffixed asset names.
The flat names are reserved case-insensitively, so names that differ only by Windows casing remain
distinct too.

## Build & Run output controls

Open **Build & Run** and start the selected project profile. The log panel keeps three output
navigation/display choices in its header:

- **Scroll to bottom** jumps to the newest line once and does not change another setting.
- **Auto-scroll output** starts enabled and follows incoming lines. Scrolling upward to read older
  output pauses and saves this setting; enable it again to jump back to the tail and resume following.
- **Truncate long lines** starts disabled. Enabling it displays each long line on one row with an
  ellipsis. It does not delete output: disabling it restores normal wrapping, and **Copy all output**
  always retains the complete line.

Auto-scroll and truncation persist locally when the panel or app is reopened. Their pressed states
and accessible names follow English, playful Hong Kong Cantonese, and bilingual language mode.

---

## Repair a failed build with Codex or OpenCode

When Build & Run fails, choose **Fix with Codex** or **Fix with opencode**. The
launch sheet lets you switch between the two local CLIs; that choice is saved
for this repository and is also available under **Repository settings → Build &
Run**. **Send to Codex/OpenCode** uses the same selector for a bounded free-form
repository request.

Nothing starts when the button merely appears. If the selected CLI is absent,
Desktop Material shows its exact npm install command and waits for consent. If
it is not signed in, open a terminal and run the displayed `codex login` or
`opencode auth login` command. Never paste a key, password, or token into the
dialog.

Auto-approve is a separate per-run choice and defaults off. With it off, an
agent can stop when an action needs approval. With it on, Codex still retains
its repository workspace-write sandbox and OpenCode retains its repository
permission block. Both agents stream bounded output to Build & Run, and **Stop**
terminates the owned process tree and prevents the verification rerun from
starting. A selected nested project folder is included in the bounded prompt,
while the repository root remains the actual process and sandbox root.

Unless you cancelled it, Desktop Material starts Build & Run again after the
agent exits. Trust the rerun result—not an agent's message or exit code—to decide
whether the repair worked. Review Changes after cancellation or a failed rerun
because partial edits may remain. A trusted repository's `.codex/config.toml`
can still enable MCP servers, so review project Codex configuration before using
repair; Desktop Material does not claim to isolate project MCPs.

---

## Notification centre

The **bell** in the app chrome opens the **notification centre** side panel. Its two named views
keep local app events separate from GitHub inbox items:

- **Local** is backed by its own git repo. An unread badge shows how many notifications you have not
  seen. Search titles and messages, filter by notification type, select every visible result, and
  apply **Mark read**, **Mark unread**, or **Delete selected** as one history-backed change. **Clear
  all** opens an inline confirmation and the notification history can restore the removed entries
  later.
- **GitHub** uses an explicit account selector with **All**, **Unread**, and **Participating only**
  controls. Refresh follows every available 50-item API page automatically, so older entries no
  longer stop at 50 or require **Load more**. Search the complete fetched titles, repositories,
  types, and reasons; select all visible matches; then mark them read or done in bulk. **Clear all**
  names the exact fetched count and requires confirmation before marking the complete selected
  GitHub inbox done with bounded concurrency. Any failed threads stay visible for retry. Changing
  account, source, filter, or search safely cancels stale work and resets the scoped selection. When
  no account is signed in, the complete **No signed-in accounts** state remains visible and tells
  you to sign in before refreshing the inbox.

The account, filters, and empty state are part of the guided inbox workflow rather than a `gh`
command or GitHub API search screen.

### Error presentation

Acknowledgement-only failures appear as dismissible red notices in the bottom-right corner by
default, without blocking the task underneath. A notice can expose bounded diagnostic details when
they differ from the user-facing message. In **Settings → Notifications**, choose either
**Bottom-right notice** or **Blocking dialog** for these acknowledgement-only errors. Failures that
need a retry, authentication choice, external remediation, or another real decision remain dialogs
regardless of that preference.

When Git reports the affected repository's exact stale `.git/index.lock`, the notice includes
**Remove lock file**. Desktop first confirms that its own repository operations are idle, then
refuses recent, linked, non-file, or changed locks before atomically quarantining and removing the
verified stale file. Retry the original Git operation after the notice closes.

## GitHub Actions panel

The **Actions** panel brings CI into the app:

- **Workflow runs** for the current repository, newest first. When more are available, choose
  **Load more runs**; already loaded pages remain visible across background polling and **Refresh**.
- **Filters** by **workflow**, **status**, **branch**, and **event**.
- **Re-run** a whole run or **re-run only the failed jobs**.
- For a run that is queued, running, waiting, or pending, choose **Cancel run**. The Material review
  names the workflow and run number plus its branch/ref, actor, and commit when GitHub supplied
  them. Desktop Material revalidates the selected repository/account/run and live cancellable state
  immediately before one normal cancel request, disables duplicate submission, and refreshes until
  GitHub reports cancelled or another terminal state. Authentication/SSO and stale/conflict errors
  keep specific recovery guidance visible; force-cancel is not the primary action.
- Drill into a run, choose the **current or a historical attempt**, and use **Load more jobs** to
  append the next bounded 50-job page. A failed later page keeps the jobs already loaded and offers
  the same named retry. Every loaded job retains its exact **View logs** and **Re-run job** actions.
- Open the **in-app log viewer** to read output without leaving Desktop Material. Search the loaded
  log to isolate a command, warning, or error; only the spatial log body may pan horizontally.
- Inspect **pending deployment environments** and prior review history. Select only environments
  for which the signed-in account is eligible, enter a required bounded comment, review the exact
  approve/reject intent, and confirm. Locked environments keep their explanation visible.
- When GitHub marks a first-time fork run as eligible, use the separate **Approve fork run**
  confirmation. It is never inferred from a deployment decision.
- Trigger manual workflows with the **`workflow_dispatch` dialog** — pick the workflow, ref, and
  inputs, and dispatch.
- **CI Windows** uses GitHub-hosted runners for pushes, pull requests, and reusable calls. A
  protected-main manual dispatch can explicitly select `cloud` or the exact
  `[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]` pool.
- The repository's **Super Express Release** emergency lane runs the complete
  script-contract suite before the Windows x64 production build/package, asset
  verification, and release. It still omits unit, TUI, lint, type, parity,
  smoke, and packaged E2E tests. A
  direct Windows `workflow_dispatch` publishes an immutable Windows Release
  marked **Latest** after preserving and verifying its artifact; the direct Linux TUI action
  and reusable packaging calls remain artifact-only so the combined dispatcher
  publishes one complete cross-platform Release. The combined dispatcher is
  self-hosted-only: preparation and publication use the registered Linux x64
  WSL runner, the Windows lane uses `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]`, and the TUI
  lane uses `[self-hosted, Linux, X64]`. A direct Windows dispatch keeps both
  package build and publication on
  `[self-hosted, Windows, X64, desktop-material-windows-local]`. Missing or busy packaging or
  publication runners queue or fail their release rather than falling back to
  a hosted runner. Ordinary CI and tested Express remain the default gates.
  Automatic CI stays on clean GitHub-hosted machines; the tested Express
  Windows jobs use the project-labelled self-hosted pool. Their release work
  keeps unique non-cancelling run/attempt groups. Only Super Express retains local packaging
  placement and same-ref cancellation. A release pull request targets the
  Windows product's `main` default branch. Windows self-hosted dependency setup
  restores an exact verified cache without a post-job archive hook, explicitly
  saves a verified miss, and can use an older cache only as a warm start while
  the current lockfiles still drive installation. A cold publisher installs
  pinned checksum-verified PortableGit, GitHub CLI, and `jq` below
  `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE`, then reuses them on later runs. The TUI's isolated profile-history repository
  also enables Git `core.longpaths` locally, so Windows history writes do not
  depend on the checkout's separate Git configuration.
- Ordinary Windows unit tests leave `NODE_OPTIONS` to `script/test.mjs`, which
  owns both the per-worker heap and memory-aware concurrency. Packaged E2E waits
  at most 300 seconds for the Squirrel installer process, terminates that tree
  on timeout, and repeatedly stops only newly launched same-session application
  processes while preserving any process that predated the test. Remote proof
  of this hosted workflow repair is still pending.
- Automatic and Super Express installers share one monotonic `z` package-version
  namespace. Automatic Express releases begin non-latest, while Super Express
  publishers request **Latest** after verified assets are present. The greatest
  release for freshly revalidated current `main` remains the only release allowed
  to own the Squirrel update feed, so an older overlapping job cannot move
  **Latest** backward.
- Select a run artifact to review its name, size, creation/expiry, workflow source, and GitHub digest.
  Search the loaded artifact catalog by name or workflow context with fuzzy, substring, or safe
  regular-expression matching; substring and regex modes can also match the digest, and the regex
  builder is available from the filter control. Choose **Load more artifacts** to append the next
  bounded page; search immediately includes each appended page. A failed later page keeps the
  cards you already loaded and lets you retry that same page.
  **Download archive** opens the native save picker; after transfer, Desktop computes SHA-256 locally,
  reports whether it matches, and offers **Show in folder**.
- The cache manager can list, search, and delete Actions caches, but **Download unavailable** is
  intentional: GitHub does not provide a supported Actions-cache archive download API. Download
  supported workflow output from that run's **Artifacts** section instead.
- **Check attestations** reports whether an attestation record is present. Presence is not presented as
  cryptographic verification: signer, signature, timestamp, source identity, and policy still need a
  future verification function.

Actions caches can be listed and deleted, but GitHub exposes no supported API
for downloading a cache archive. **Download unavailable** says so directly;
use a workflow artifact when output must be downloadable and integrity-reported.

The historical M0–M19 production gates exercised 50→51 filtered runs, 30→31 artifacts, and current/historical 50→51
job pages, including a deliberate later-page 503→200 retry. Exact job log/re-run, deployment review,
and fork approval mutations ran only against the isolated provider. At regular and short windows
plus a requested 200% base with auto-fit, document and body widths matched and the measured Actions
surfaces had no clipping, overlap, outside controls, oversized text, or page-level sideways
scrolling. Modal focus and scrim ownership were also contained. These are named app controls; there
is no `gh` command, API-path, or GraphQL editor.

Job-log downloads follow GitHub's signed redirect automatically. Desktop Material's main-process
request filter tracks the original request and removes authentication, authorization, and cookie
headers before any cross-origin hop. Download errors also omit signed URLs and query strings. The
live Windows x64 proof below shows the resulting searchable, collapsible log viewer.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Windows x64 GitHub Actions job log loaded securely in the searchable in-app viewer.*

If GitHub is still preparing a completed job's archive, the log endpoint can
temporarily return `HTTP 404`. The viewer now retries that API response with a
bounded 250/750/1,500 ms schedule and obtains a fresh signed redirect on each
attempt. When the bound is exhausted, it explains the provider state and keeps
**Retry** and **Open on GitHub** available; it never sends the API bearer to the
cross-origin log host.

## Repository Releases

Open **Releases** from the repository rail to work with the selected GitHub repository without
losing its account context. The dashboard summarizes the releases currently loaded, including
stable, prerelease, and draft counts, combined asset/download totals, and the latest stable release.
The desktop catalog uses a wider 420–560 px pane and larger rows and controls; below 900 px it
stacks above the detail pane instead of squeezing text. At the corrected 800×560 combined
small-width/short-height gate, the header and metrics compact, the list moves ahead of overview/
detail content, and one complete release row stays visible at 125% (768×528 CSS), 150%
(640×440 CSS), and 200% (480×330 CSS) in one 960×660 physical window. The compact layout keeps
9–16 px text, 30–34 px controls, a 176 px tools panel, and at least a 52 px release row instead of
shrinking labels to 7–8 px. Metrics reflow into three columns, and the saved English, playful
Hong Kong Cantonese, or bilingual tools label can wrap without clipping.

- Search the loaded catalog with fuzzy, substring, or regular-expression matching, optionally
  case-sensitive, and combine it with the **Published**, **Pre-release**, or **Draft** status filter.
  The result count always says how many loaded releases are shown; **Load more releases** expands the
  catalog before filtering when GitHub reports another bounded page. In the compact gate,
  **Filters and selection** is a localized native keyboard-operable disclosure. Clearing a selection after a
  filter produces zero results returns focus to an enabled fallback rather than disabled select-all.
- Select a release to inspect its status, author, tag, target branch or commit, creation and publish
  times, notes, asset count, and total downloads. Row timestamps use unambiguous 24-hour `HH:mm`
  time. Open the exact provider release page when GitHub supplies a validated repository URL.
- Asset cards show file type, size, upload dates, download count, and digest when available. Existing
  guarded actions still create or edit drafts, publish or delete a reviewed release, upload or delete
  an asset, and download an asset through bounded transfer and integrity checks. Only after the
  verified download completes, **Open file** appears beside **Show in folder**.
- Initial loading, asset loading, no-releases, no-filter-match, invalid-regex, and provider-error states
  remain distinct. A failed release or asset request names the failed operation and retries that same
  scope without discarding already loaded data.

The accepted compact image is the 200% frame from the successful 100%, 125%,
150%, and 200% constant-physical-size gate. It is a 960×660 physical capture of
the CSS 480×330 viewport with zero horizontal overflow and one complete row.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Compact Repository Releases at 200 percent scale with one complete row and the keyboard-reachable Filters and selection disclosure.*

### Repository Packages

Switch the repository's **Distribution** surface from **Releases** to
**Packages** to browse npm, Maven, RubyGems, Docker, NuGet, and container
packages. Desktop Material first refreshes the repository's numeric GitHub ID
and excludes every owner package without that exact association. Package and
version lists support ordinary, fuzzy, substring, and regular-expression
search, case sensitivity, and the full Regex Builder.

On GitHub.com, **Publish a file package** reviews one local file and publishes
it as an app-owned GHCR/OCI artifact under a new unique tag, then reports the
immutable digest reference. **Download file** accepts only an exact digest and
only after verifying the app artifact type, source repository, one safe title,
and the layer's size and SHA-256; the final save never overwrites an existing
path. Other ecosystems and general container images remain metadata/link
workflows for their normal registry clients. See the
[GitHub Packages explorer contract](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.2e8e100f04168f0a)
for limits, failure recovery, and credential handling.

## UI scaling

Desktop Material scales its whole interface independently of the OS:

- Open the **scaling slider** and set anywhere from **50% to 200%**.
- Or choose **auto-fit to window**, which picks a scale that fits the current window size.
- Auto-fit treats your slider value as the requested maximum. If the window is too small, it caps
  the effective scale instead of multiplying the requested scale again. At the supported minimum
  window size, 200% auto-fits below that maximum so the title bar, navigation rail, Appearance
  cards, value, and footer remain visible without horizontal clipping. The latest P0 gate measured
  94%; the older screenshot below records a 96% viewport.

Combined with the animated light/dark theme, this lets you tune the workspace for a laptop panel, a
4K monitor, or a shared screen without touching system display settings.

The responsive toolbar gate measures the space its controls actually need. As the window narrows,
**Build & Run** enters **More toolbar actions** first and **Commit & Push** enters next; the
repository, worktree, branch, and sync controls remain available in the app bar. Opening More keeps
the moved actions keyboard reachable. After the surface closes and the window widens, Commit & Push
and then Build & Run return to their original positions, with no page-level horizontal overflow.

The Pages gallery also has a dedicated accessibility/clipping check at 960×660 and 390×844. It
passes with zero axe violations, matching document/body widths, and no horizontally outside
elements.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Requested 200 percent UI scale auto-fitted to 96 percent at the minimum window size.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Responsive regression proof at 1450 by 997 with toolbar and Changes controls fully contained and no horizontal overflow.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Measured narrow toolbar with its complete More actions surface.*

## Automation and merge-all

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Two conflicting file streams reconciled into one verified result.*

Open **Settings → Automation** to configure the two background schedules:

1. Turn on **Automatically commit and push** and/or **Automatically pull**.
2. Pick an interval for each enabled operation.
3. Under **Account overrides**, let an identity inherit the global value or override its enabled
   state and interval.
4. For one repository, open **Repository settings → Automation** and inherit or override the two
   schedules again.

Automation targets the selected repository only. Before each run it checks repository state,
upstream availability, conflicts, in-progress Git operations, and draft commit text. An unsafe
repository is skipped rather than overwritten. See Automation for the complete guard
table.

Scheduled Git is non-interactive. It uses an already selected/stored credential or fails through a
notification without opening a login, credential-manager, SSH, or pinentry window. Scheduled
commit, pull, and push skip repository hooks; automatic commits and pull-created commits also
disable signing, and post-push SSH deployment uses batch mode. Manual Git actions remain
interactive and continue to honor normal hook and signing choices. Repositories that require hooks
or signatures should use reviewed manual operations and remote branch protection.

The Branches and Worktrees views also expose **Merge all branches** and **Merge all worktrees**.
Confirm the target, follow each row's progress, and review any skipped or failed target. When
Copilot conflict assistance is available, it participates inside the same guarded workflow.

When the current branch is `main`, choose **Choose a branch to merge into main** from the
Branches menu to open the merge sheet. Its **Not updated with main** chip filters by Git
ancestry: a branch remains visible when its tip does not contain the current `main` tip, while
a diverged branch that already contains `main` stays out of the result. The chip uses the same
English, Hong Kong-style Cantonese, and bilingual language modes as the rest of the app and
composes with text and regex filtering. If Git cannot resolve the default tip, the chip is
withheld and the ordinary branch list remains available.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Merge into main chooser with Not updated with main active.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Automation preferences with global and account overrides.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Merge all branches with per-target progress.*

## History search and graph

Open **History** and use the search field to match a commit's title, message, tag, or hash. The
results retain the normal commit detail view. Toggle **Show commit graph** to add ancestry lanes and
merge edges beside the unfiltered list; turn the graph off when a compact list is more useful. For
readable three-column ancestry work, choose **Graph** in the repository navigation rail: it is a
dedicated full-width page with the same scope, filters, lane controls, selection, and commit actions.

Right-click a commit row for reset, checkout, reorder, revert, branch, tag, cherry-pick, copy, and
provider actions. The row's named **More actions** button, the Context Menu key, and `Shift+F10`
open the same action set. Invoking an unselected commit targets only that row; invoking a member of
the current multi-selection preserves the selection for eligible multi-commit actions.
Hovering or keyboard-focusing a commit also shows its exact authored timestamp
and an auto-updating relative line such as **2 minutes ago**.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: History search and commit graph.*

History also exposes the two view modes as explicit, keyboard-accessible tabs:
choose **Commit list** for the dense review list or **Graph** for the continuous
branch lanes. The selected view persists with the repository tab, and arrow,
Home, and End keys move through the tab strip.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: History Commit list tab from the built Windows app.*

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: History commit hover card showing an exact timestamp and relative age.*

---

## Multiple stashes

Create a stash from the Changes workflow whenever work must be set aside. Desktop Material keeps
all stash entries instead of treating only the newest one as available; the inventory has no
Desktop entry-count cap:

1. Expand **Stashes** in Changes and select an entry by its label.
2. Inspect that stash's file list and individual diffs before acting.
3. Choose apply or pop for the exact entry, or review rename, create-branch, and delete actions.
4. If Git completes only part of an operation, keep the reported state visible and inspect the
   repository before retrying instead of assuming an all-or-nothing result.

Switching branches can still offer to stash local work, and the resulting entry appears in the same
list.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Stash Manager with browser-style Manage, Export, History, and Appearance and voice pages.*

The full manager is rendered through the shared dialog layer, keeping every
tab and export control centered and usable above the Changes pane. The hidden
Windows capture below is the accepted 1443×992 runtime proof.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Centered stash manager dialog with Manage, Export, History, and Appearance and voice tabs.*

Choose **Open full manager** for the complete workflow. Its browser-style tabs keep Manage, Export,
History, and Appearance and voice as independently closable pages; use the plus and overflow actions
to reopen a page without losing the current stash review. Its tabs provide a regex-capable search
and multi-selection export to a directory, ZIP, or 7z. The 7z panel exposes compression method,
level, dictionary, match finder, fast bytes, solid mode, threads, split volumes, password, and
encrypted headers. The History tab keeps exact object IDs visible for recovery review, while
Appearance and voice exposes the shared language mode and both independent funny-level sliders
before routing to full appearance settings.

---

## Repository power tools

- Open the repositories side sheet and choose **Pull all** to fetch/pull every eligible repository;
  review the per-repository result instead of assuming the batch succeeded as one unit. If the
  normal pull ends in an HTTPS authentication or repository-not-found ambiguity, Desktop Material
  can try the remaining token-bearing signed-in accounts whose HTML origin exactly matches that
  remote. A repository-bound identity is preferred within the otherwise stable account order.
- Pin important repositories from their context menu, hide the automatically maintained Recent
  group if desired, and use grouping to keep large repository lists manageable.
- Use branch presets/default-branch controls when creating or switching branches; pin, hide, solo,
  and restore branch visibility from branch context and filtered-state controls.
- Set a repository-specific external editor when the global editor is not appropriate.
- Manage every named remote in **Repository settings → Remote**, and administer add/move/rename/
  lock/repair/remove/prune worktree operations from the Worktrees view. Remote names and URLs wrap
  only when genuinely long; before a field/control column becomes unreadable, each row changes to a
  single-column layout with fetch/push controls and actions in keyboard order.
- In the same **Remote** settings page, save a non-secret SSH working-copy definition and keep its
  password or key passphrase in the operating-system credential vault. Turn on **Deploy Docker
  Compose after pushes to this source remote** to deploy only after Desktop Material successfully
  pushes that named remote. The SSH checkout must already be on the pushed branch; the app fetches
  that exact branch, requires a fast-forward merge, and then runs
  `docker compose up --detach --build`. A mismatched branch or non-fast-forward update stops without
  a reset, force operation, or automatic checkout. **Deploy Docker now** runs the same bounded,
  output-redacted SSH recipe on demand. Host-key, passphrase, password, generic Git credential, and
  GitHub sign-in prompts share one FIFO, so concurrent prompts appear and settle one at a time.
- Open the wider **Repository settings → Submodules** surface and choose **Add submodule…** to browse GitHub.com,
  Enterprise, GitLab, or Bitbucket with the appropriate exact account, or enter an HTTPS, SSH, or
  local Git URL. Review the repository-relative checkout path and optional branch; Desktop rechecks
  duplicate/occupied destinations immediately before Git, reports bounded clone progress, and lets
  you cancel the running operation before refreshing the managed list. The same tab shows a Back
  preview: `Shift`+right-click it (or focus it and press the Context Menu key or `Shift+F10`) to
  open that element's appearance editor beside it. Changes remain staged with the rest of
  Repository Settings until **Save**. The adjacent
  **Subtrees** tab embeds the full add, pull, push, and split manager. The same managed list opens
  as the Submodule Manager from the Tools tab's **Nested repositories** category, and clone-list
  rows show a submodule badge whose details dialog can clone any submodule as its own repository.
  New to submodules? The beginner-friendly Submodules page walks the whole workflow
  in plain words and pictures.
- On any initialized Submodule Manager row or changed/new submodule commit card, choose **Open
  temporary viewer** to inspect that checked-out child read-only in the current workspace without
  importing it. It does not enter the repository list, Recent, or the persisted last selection.
  The context bar's **Close viewer** action and Back control both return to the saved root and
  clear temporary state; repeated Open, Close, or Back activation cannot create another tab
  or repository entry. `Shift`+right-click the actual Back control—or focus it and use the
  Context Menu key or `Shift+F10`—to open the same anchored editor and save its profile-wide style
  or label immediately.
  Uninitialized, stale, invalid-Git, traversal, sibling-prefix, and symlink/junction escape targets
  fail without changing repository persistence, and the manager stays available for recovery.

- Use the `.gitignore` manager and one-click Build & Run for project-aware cleanup and execution. Build & Run discovers common nested projects across Node, Deno, Rust, Go, .NET, Python, JVM, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Dart/Flutter, Elixir, Scala, Haskell, Zig, Make, and CMake; choose a profile by its displayed project folder when several projects share a language or toolchain.
- Open **Repository tools** for the full set of named, reviewed Git functions. Diagnostics cover the
  status summary, repository health check, commit-signature audit, branch sync overview, contributor
  summary, nearest-tag version description, whitespace/conflict-marker audit, an ignored-files
  preview, and a commit-notes view. **Inspect and search** adds **Line authorship**, which shows the
  commit, author, and date behind every line of one picked tracked file; **Search tracked
  content**, a bounded literal-text search across tracked files with file and line references that
  can optionally be scoped to one branch, tag, HEAD, or commit ID — a matchless search completes
  cleanly rather than reporting an error; and **Edit commit notes**, which saves, replaces, or
  removes the free-form Git note on one commit only after a dedicated review step that shows the
  exact commit and note text. Maintenance covers the
  maintenance preview and run, a fully-merged-branch audit, unreachable-object prune preview, and a
  two-step untracked cleanup: **Preview untracked cleanup** lists exactly what would be deleted, and
  **Remove untracked files** deletes it only after its own destructive confirmation (tracked and
  ignored files are always preserved). Recovery covers the reflog view and an unreachable-commit
  finder for locating work lost to a deleted branch or reset. Every function runs a fixed, reviewed
  Git recipe — there is no shell and no editable command line; the only accepted inputs are a picked
  in-repository file and one bounded line of literal search text.

At compact heights, the Repository Tools workspace itself scrolls vertically so the Diagnostics
section, results, and later actions remain reachable without a horizontal page scrollbar.

SSH and non-authentication failures never start account fallback. The selected stable account key
stays in the app's internal trampoline map; its selector field is removed from the Git options
before spawn and never enters child, hook, Git LFS, or log environments. A missing same-origin
selection fails closed, while credential requests from cross-origin submodules retain normal
account resolution. Successful fallback uses the neutral result **Pull completed using another
signed-in account.**

---

## Multi-window workflows

Right-click a repository and choose **Open in new window**. Worktree context menus offer **Open
Worktree in New Window** as well. Each window maintains its own selected repository and repository
tabs, and native/menu/CLI actions route to the correct window. Closing and reopening the app
restores the persisted window tab state.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Open a repository or worktree in another window.*

---

## Agent access and CLI

Open **Settings → Agent access** and turn on **Enable local agent server**. The panel shows the
random loopback address, MCP URL, and bearer token; reveal/copy the token only for a trusted local
client, and use **Regenerate token** to disconnect existing clients immediately.

For the phone-first site, select **Paired LAN devices**, start the server, and choose **Open mobile
connection page** in the **Mobile connection** card. Desktop Material replaces any old pairing code
and opens a fresh five-minute one-use `/connect` link in the default browser. The secret stays in the
URL fragment, so it is not sent to the site server, and the mobile page removes it from browser
history before exchange. Selecting the button again invalidates the previous code. In Local-only or
stopped-server state, the card remains visible and explains which prerequisite is missing instead of
opening an unusable link.

Set the remote-site address and optional HTTPS gateway in the same panel before pairing. Direct LAN
HTTP authenticates but does not encrypt traffic; use a trusted private network or configured HTTPS
gateway. A browser-open failure reports a generic error without copying the pairing secret into logs.

- HTTP-capable MCP clients connect to the displayed `/mcp` URL with an
  `Authorization: Bearer …` header.
- Stdio-only clients run `node script/agent/mcp-stdio-proxy.js`.
- Scripts can start with `node script/agent/desktop-agent.js info` and use the fallback command-line
  client for the same bounded command contract.

The contract covers account/repository/tab discovery, repository status, single/batch clone,
commit, fetch/pull/push, branch creation/merge, tab selection, automation status/runs, Actions
workflow dispatch, and the active profile's repository-bound named API read functions. It never
returns provider credentials. See Agent API for command and security details.
