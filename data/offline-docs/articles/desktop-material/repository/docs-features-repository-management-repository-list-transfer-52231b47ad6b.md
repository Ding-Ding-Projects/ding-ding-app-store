# Repository list transfer and Cheap LFS

Repository list transfer moves a reviewed set of cloned repositories between
Desktop Material profiles or machines. It is deliberately a clone recipe, not
a credential or storage-state backup.

## Behavior and configuration

- **Export** resolves each selected repository's GitHub clone URL, or its
  `origin`/first Git remote when no GitHub metadata is available.
- Export sanitizes HTTP(S) user information, removes query and fragment data,
  and writes only a versioned list of portable clone URLs plus an export
  timestamp. Local checkout paths, `file:` URLs, access tokens, account
  identities, default branches, and Cheap LFS file selections are not portable
  data in this format.
- **Import** lets the user review and check the URLs, choose a destination
  directory, and run the existing bounded parallel or sequential batch-clone
  queue.
- After each successful batch clone, the same finalization path used by normal
  cloning calls the automatic Cheap LFS materializer. It is enabled by default
  by the repository setting **Download large files after cloning**.
- With no portable file selection, restoration considers the detected pointer
  set. Release-backed pointers require an eligible selected account; public OCI
  pointers may restore anonymously. The imported list does not silently choose
  a different account on behalf of the user.

## Failure modes and recovery

- An invalid, unsupported, or structurally corrupt list is rejected before any
  clone starts.
- Import also rejects a non-portable URL before it can reach `git clone`; the
  accepted schemes are HTTP(S), SSH, Git-over-SSH, Git, and Git's scp-like SSH
  spelling.
- URLs already present in the local repository list are shown as already
  cloned and are not checked by default.
- A clone failure is isolated to its batch row. Other rows can complete, and
  the queue's existing pause, cancel, retry, and crash-recovery behavior still
  applies.
- If automatic Cheap LFS restoration is disabled, no eligible provider account
  is available, or a provider object cannot be verified, the clone remains
  usable with its pointer files intact. The user can enable the repository
  setting or restore the files later from the repository's Cheap LFS surface.
- An explicit manifest-bound Cheap LFS selection is intentionally not exported:
  it can become stale when the default branch, manifest, pointer set, or
  account changes on another machine. The clone UI can create a fresh selection
  at the destination when that precision is needed.

## Security considerations

The transfer file is safe to share only as a list of repository locations, not
as an authentication artifact. HTTP(S) userinfo, query strings, and fragments
are removed on both export and parse, and local/file URLs are rejected rather
than treated as clone sources. The format never serializes account tokens,
local paths, release credentials, registry credentials, or Cheap LFS selection
proofs. Account affinity remains in local repository state, and automatic
restoration uses the same selected-account and provider checks as every other
Cheap LFS operation.

## Verification

- `repo-list-file-test.ts` proves URL normalization, credential stripping,
  query/fragment removal, portable-URL enforcement, duplicate removal, and
  malformed-file rejection.
- `repository-list-transfer-cheap-lfs-test.ts` pins the URL-only contract,
  verifies that imported clones enter the batch finalization materialization
  path, verifies the enabled-by-default preference, and checks localized
  transfer copy.
- `account-search-test.ts` proves private email metadata stays out of search
  and self-hosted provider labels remain accurate. The account-switcher tests
  cover invalid-regex activation blocking, listbox semantics, keyboard
  activation, and narrow-layout rules.
- The Windows production build and the hidden-desktop acceptance flow should
  exercise the import dialog's large-file note and the batch finalization
  progress surface when a disposable pointer fixture is available.
