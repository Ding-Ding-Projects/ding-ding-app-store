# Installing Desktop Material

Desktop Material has two distinct runtime surfaces. The graphical Electron
edition is supported on Windows only and publishes Windows x64 installers plus
a Squirrel update feed. The new Python/Textual terminal edition targets Linux;
it builds a wheel and source distribution and does not claim to be a Linux
Electron package.

## Linux terminal edition

Install Python 3.10–3.13, Git, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run
the following from the trusted parent directory where the checkout should be
created:

One-line Linux shell installation from a fresh parent directory:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material.git && cd desktop-material && uv tool install ./tui && uv tool update-shell
```

One-line Windows PowerShell installation from a fresh parent directory:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material.git; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'git clone failed' }; Set-Location .\desktop-material; uv tool install .\tui; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'uv tool install failed' }; uv tool update-shell
```



Close and reopen the terminal afterward so the updated `PATH` is loaded, then
run `github /path/to/repository` on Linux or
`github C:\path\to\repository` on Windows. The fully interactive acceptance
target remains Linux-first; the Windows Terminal launch path and cross-platform
core are also tested.

The installed `github`, `dmt`, and `desktop-material-tui` commands are
identical TUI launchers. The literal alias does not replace GitHub CLI's `gh`.
If `github` already names another command or shell alias, use `dmt` or
`desktop-material-tui` instead. From a repository, inspect the launcher and
machine-readable status with:

```bash
github --help
github status --json
```

Cheap-LFS-aware native Git forms are available immediately after installation:

```bash
github push --dry-run
github push origin main
github pull --ff-only
github git status --short
```

See the [Git wrapper contract](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.a7cdbfe097141946) for
preflight, restore, exit-code, and non-overwrite behavior.

The locked contributor route remains:

```bash
cd tui
uv sync --locked --extra dev
uv run desktop-material-tui
```

`pipx install ./tui` is the corresponding isolated install route. GitHub
surfaces additionally require an installed and authenticated `gh` CLI.

CI builds `desktop_material_tui-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` and the corresponding
source distribution as a short-lived workflow artifact. No immutable Linux
Release asset is claimed until one is actually published. See the complete
[Linux TUI installation and packaging
guide](features/linux-tui/install-and-packaging.md).

For an isolated container installation, build the local wheel into the
non-root image:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg APP_UID="$(id -u)" \
  --build-arg APP_GID="$(id -g)" \
  --tag desktop-material-tui:local \
  ./tui
```

The complete [container guide](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.235ef21b88b0aba2) provides the
copy-paste interactive `docker run --rm -it` command, current-repository bind
mount, and persistent XDG config/data/state/cache volumes.

## Windows

From Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7, the verified current-user install
is:

```powershell
Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-RestMethod 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/main/script/install-windows.ps1' | Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-Expression
```

The tracked script resolves this repository's latest release, verifies the
published GitHub SHA-256 asset digest and any Authenticode signature, installs
for the current user, and removes its temporary download. Current builds are
unsigned, which the script reports after digest verification.

For an unattended install, verified refresh, or uninstall, review the script
and invoke it as a script block so parameters can be passed:

```powershell
$installer = [scriptblock]::Create((Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Invoke-RestMethod 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/main/script/install-windows.ps1'))
& $installer -Operation Install -InstallScope CurrentUser
& $installer -Operation Update -InstallScope CurrentUser
& $installer -Operation Uninstall -InstallScope CurrentUser
```

`Install` is the default and may refresh an existing complete installation.
`Update` requires an existing complete installation. `Uninstall` is idempotent
when the app is already absent. Install downloads and verifies the exact native
setup asset, then runs it with Squirrel's supported `--silent` flag. Update
validates that the release has the exact native setup asset, then runs the
already-installed updater against that release's immutable tag URL with
`--update=<url> --silent`; it does not turn an update into a destructive full
reinstall. Uninstall runs the same installed current-user `Update.exe` with
`--uninstall --silent`; it never downloads an executable for removal.

The only supported scope is `CurrentUser`, rooted at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubDesktop`. An `AllUsers` argument is rejected. The generated
MSI is a machine deployment bootstrapper that arranges per-user installation at
logon; it is not a conventional machine-wide Desktop Material payload and the
script does not present it as one. Run mutating operations from a normal,
non-administrator PowerShell session; the script rejects an elevated token
before Squirrel can display its unsupported-elevation error. Install also
preflights Squirrel's .NET Framework 4.5 minimum and fails with a recovery
instruction instead of opening a framework installer or reboot prompt.

Before changing files, every operation detects a running installed app and
asks the caller to close it normally. It never force-kills Desktop Material.
The script starts Squirrel hidden, waits up to 15 minutes for its process,
propagates any nonzero child exit as failure, and then waits up to one minute
for the expected installed or removed postcondition. A success receipt includes
the operation, scope, Squirrel exit code, installation root, and final
executable path where applicable. `-ResolveOnly` returns the exact planned file
and arguments without downloading or changing the installation.

For a manual installation, download one of these assets from the
[latest Ding-Ding-Projects release](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/releases/latest):

- `GitHubDesktopSetup-x64.exe` installs for the current user.
- `GitHubDesktopSetup-x64.msi` provides Squirrel's machine deployment
  bootstrapper; it still installs the application per user at logon.
- `GitHub.Desktop-x64.zip` is the portable package; extract it before running
  the packaged executable.

An unsupported architecture or a missing or unverifiable graphical-edition
release asset fails closed. Use a supported Windows x64 system or Windows
virtual machine for Electron; the Linux TUI is a separate interface and not a
compatibility mode for that binary.

## Data directories

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubDesktop\` contains the installed application and
  retained update versions.
- `%APPDATA%\GitHub Desktop\` contains user-specific application data and is
  created on first launch.

## Log files

Application logs are stored below the user data directory in a `logs`
subdirectory, organized as `YYYY-MM-DD.desktop.production.log`.

Installer and updater diagnostics are stored in:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubDesktop\SquirrelSetup.log` for updates after install.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SquirrelSetup.log` for the initial installation. This file
  may contain entries for other Squirrel applications, so focus on
  `GitHubDesktop.exe`.
