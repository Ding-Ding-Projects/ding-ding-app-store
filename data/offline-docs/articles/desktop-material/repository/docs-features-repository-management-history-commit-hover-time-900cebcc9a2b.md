# History commit hover time

History commit rows expose an accessible hover/focus card with the author and
authored date. The date now carries both the exact localized timestamp and a
second relative line such as **2 minutes ago**, so a user can scan recency
without losing the audit-grade time.

## Behavior and configuration

- Hover a commit row, or reach it with the keyboard, to open the same card.
- The first date line uses the app's full localized date and short time format.
- The second line updates through the shared relative-time component as the
  commit ages. It is visually quieter but remains ordinary readable text.
- The phrase follows English, Hong Kong Cantonese, or bilingual mode; bilingual
  cards show both forms, for example **2 minutes ago · 2 分鐘前**.
- No preference is required; exact and relative forms are complementary rather
  than mutually exclusive.

## Failure modes

An invalid or unavailable commit date continues through the existing shared
date formatting behavior. The relative line does not replace the exact value,
so a stale relative refresh cannot remove the timestamp a user needs for
comparison or audit.

## Security considerations

The card renders commit metadata already loaded for the History list. It makes
no network request, does not inspect working-tree contents, and persists
nothing.

## Verification

`history-context-menu-test.tsx` fixes the clock and proves that one hover card
contains both the exact formatted date and the bilingual relative phrase. The
`history-hover-time` off-screen Windows scene focuses a real built commit row,
requires a visible relative-time element inside the contained card, and
captures the result.
