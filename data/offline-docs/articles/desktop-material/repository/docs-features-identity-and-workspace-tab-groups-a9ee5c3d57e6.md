# Tab groups

Repository tabs can be collected into named, colored groups. A group is an
organizational label over the existing strip: it never changes what a tab does,
never closes a tab, and never alters which repository a tab is bound to.
Every non-empty group has a visible chip before its first member, so its name,
color, member count, expanded/collapsed state, and active-group state remain
readable without relying on the members' color bands alone.

*Image omitted from the offline bundle: Historical restart-restored tab-group acceptance at immutable source commit 58be6fe5953477b015a134c414a8cf82363ecc75.*

This immutable July 22 frame preserves the accepted bytes from that milestone;
it is not current-build visual evidence for the #94/#95 corrections below.

## Behavior and configuration

Right-click any tab to reach its group actions:

- **Add tab to new group…** opens a small dialog for the group's name and one
  of six curated colors (blue, green, yellow, red, purple, grey). The
  right-clicked tab becomes the group's first member.
- **Move tab to group…** is one stable menu item regardless of whether the
  profile has two groups or two hundred. It opens a bounded, searchable
  destination dialog instead of expanding every group into the native context
  menu. Choosing a group moves the tab beside that group's last member, so the
  group remains one contiguous run. A grouped tab also gets a **No group**
  destination that removes only its label and leaves the tab open. Incompatible
  pinned/unpinned destinations are omitted because no group may cross the
  strip's protected pin boundary.
- **Collapse/Expand “name”** toggles the group's real strip state. Collapsing
  hides every member tab but keeps the named group chip visible; clicking the
  chip, or pressing Enter/Space while it is focused, expands the members again.
- **Show tabs in “name”** opens the group's member dropdown (see below).
- **Edit group “name”…** opens the rename/recolor dialog (see below).
- **Delete group “name”** removes the label only. Every tab that belonged to
  it stays open and simply becomes ungrouped.

### Move destination dialog

The move dialog owns the scale problem that a native context menu cannot. Its
list is height-bounded and scrollable, exposes a live result count, and filters
group names without changing or closing a tab until a destination is chosen.
Plain text remains the default; substring and regex are explicit modes through
the shared `FilterModeControl` and full regex builder. Invalid regex input is
reported inline, and an honest no-match state keeps the query available for
correction.

Focus begins in the search combobox. ↑/↓,
Home/End move the listbox highlight,
Enter/Space choose it, and Esc cancels. The
dialog restores focus to the tab or overflow control that opened the context
menu. Group names are ellipsized visually but retained in each option's full
accessible name. The title, instructions, search copy, counts, no-match state,
and announcements follow the active English, Cantonese, or bilingual mode.

## The group chip cluster

Each group's chip is a two-control cluster: the pill itself folds and unfolds
the group, and the trailing button beside it opens the group's **member
dropdown**. Both are ordinary buttons, so both are reachable by mouse and by
keyboard, and the strip reserves the width of the whole cluster when deciding
which tabs overflow.

### Member dropdown

The dropdown lists **every** tab in the group, including while the group is
collapsed and its members are absent from the strip entirely. That is the point:
before it existed, a collapsed group was a dead end — the only way to reach a
tab inside it was to expand the group first.

Choosing a member stays **one** action. A single press selects that tab's
repository, activates the tab, and closes the dropdown; there is no confirmation
step and no second click.

It is a keyboard-navigable listbox driven from either its search field or the
list itself: ↑/↓ move the highlight, Home/
End jump to the ends, Enter (and Space, from the
list) activates, and Esc closes. The search carries the same stack as
every other collection surface — plain text by default, substring and regex as
explicit opt-ins through the shared `FilterModeControl` and its full regex
builder — and an invalid pattern reports itself without hiding a single member.

The dropdown also carries the group's own actions at its foot: **Edit group…**,
**Collapse/Expand**, and **Delete group**, alongside a line stating that
deleting clears the label only and every tab stays open.

### Edit dialog

**Edit group…** opens a dialog with the group's current name and its current
curated color. Saving renames and recolors the group and nothing else: its
membership, its position in the strip, the pin boundary, and every open tab are
untouched, which is why the dialog's intro states the exact member count rather
than implying an edit might disturb it. A blank or whitespace-only name keeps
the confirm action disabled.

The rename and recolor reach the profile store the same way every other tab
mutation does, so they survive restart, profile switching, and settings-history
restore.

### Where the group dialogs are drawn

Both group dialogs render inside the app's `#dialog-layer`, the single
top-level layer that owns every floating dialog, rather than inline in the tab
strip that opens them. That layer is what supplies a dialog's whole geometry
and elevation contract: `#dialog-layer dialog[open]` sets `position: fixed`,
centres the dialog, bounds it to the viewport, and puts it at
`--popup-z-index`.

The distinction is not cosmetic. `Dialog` always carries the `tooltip-host`
class, and `.tooltip-host { position: relative }` overrides the
`position: absolute` a `<dialog>` gets from the user-agent stylesheet, so a
dialog rendered anywhere else is laid out as an ordinary in-flow box with
`z-index: auto`. Rendered inline it therefore became a flex item of the tab
strip — stretching the strip around itself and painting underneath the app
bar's Fetch origin, Commit & push and Build & run pills, which are positioned
and come later in the document. That was the defect in
[#92](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/issues/92); the
layer membership, not a raised z-index number, is the fix and the contract.

Tooltips (`--tooltip-z-index`), the Material context menu on its own backdrop,
notifications, and the regex-builder layer all remain above or beside the popup
layer exactly as before.

Manual movement preserves membership while a tab stays beside the rest of its
group. Moving it outside that run explicitly ungroups only the moved tab. The
A–Z, opened-time, repository-status, and favorite arrangements treat each
named group as one stable block, using its first member as the block's sort key,
so an unrelated tab can never be sorted into the middle of a group.

A grouped tab shows a colored band along its top edge and a matching tint on
hover and while active. The group chip adds its name, color dot, member count,
chevron, expanded state, and active marker without changing tab geometry,
height, or minimum width. Successful changes announce what happened and return
focus to the chip when a collapse, expansion, or move would otherwise remove
the focused tab from view.

## Drag preview and recently closed tabs

Dragging now has a visible, bounded drop target: the lifted tab rises with a
small tilt and shadow, the compatible target gains a tonal highlight, and a
pulsing accent rail marks whether the drop will land before or after it. The
preview is cleared on drop, cancellation, or a rejected pinned/unpinned
boundary crossing. Keyboard movement remains available, so drag is an
enhancement rather than the only route to reorder tabs. Reduced-motion users
get the same target and announcement without the transforms or pulse.

The trailing tab-strip history button opens **Tab history**, a local list of up
to twelve recently closed tabs. It has its own plain-text search with explicit
substring/regex modes and the shared regex builder. **Restore** returns the
original tab object, including its group, pin, favorite, label, and appearance;
**Forget** removes one entry, and **Clear history** removes the list without
touching open tabs. Repository-removal cleanup is intentionally excluded from
the reopen list because the repository is no longer available. The list is
stored per profile and window, with older profiles treating the optional list
as empty.

Groups are stored per profile and per window alongside the tabs themselves.
Open, close, bulk-close, session-import, reload, and legacy-primary mirroring
preserve the group array, so names, colors, membership, collapse state, and
unknown forward-compatible fields survive restart, profile/window switching,
and settings-history restore.

`IProfileTabsState.closedTabs` is optional and bounded by the store; profiles
written before tab history existed continue to load with no reopen entries.

All group actions, dialog copy, state announcements, accessible names, color
names, and chip descriptions follow the persisted language mode: English,
playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese, or compact bilingual text. English remains
the fallback for an unknown mode.

## Persistence and compatibility

`IProfileTabsState.groups` and `IRepositoryTab.groupId` are both optional. A
profile written before groups existed loads unchanged and needs no migration
or rewrite. Both the tab and group records retain unknown keys, so a session
written by a newer release and then opened by an older one does not lose
fields it does not understand.

A `groupId` that does not match any declared group is treated as ungrouped
rather than discarded, so a downgrade followed by an upgrade does not silently
strip membership.

Portable **File → Export current tabs…** files intentionally omit group
definitions and each tab's `groupId`. Groups belong to the destination profile,
and exporting membership without its profile-local definition would create a
dangling reference. Import still preserves the current profile's group
definitions while replacing or merging the portable tab list.

## Failure modes and recovery

Creating a group with a blank or whitespace-only name is rejected and the
dialog's confirm action stays disabled. Names are whitespace-collapsed and
truncated to 64 characters on entry.

Moving a tab to a group id that no longer exists ungroups it instead of
leaving a dangling reference. Deleting a group is always non-destructive to
tabs; there is no path from group management to closing a repository tab. A
move that would mix pinned and unpinned members is a safe no-op and does not
write an invalid order. A malformed profile that already mixes pin kinds keeps
the first member's side and safely treats incompatible later members as
ungrouped while compacting valid members into one run.

The move chooser is stricter than the low-level repair behavior because its
options can become stale while the dialog is open. Activation rereads the live
source tab, destination group, current membership, and pin boundary in the same
turn that starts the mutation. A closed source, deleted non-null destination,
removed current group, or newly incompatible pin state dismisses the chooser,
announces failure, restores focus to a still-connected owner, and performs no
group write. Closing and later reopening a tab with the same stable id cannot
resurrect the old chooser request.

Transient group rows and controls can disappear while their keyboard tooltip is
pending or visible—for example, when filtering, collapsing, or deleting their
owner. The shared tooltip lifecycle observes connectivity only during that
pending/visible interval. Removing the owner cancels timers, removes the portal,
stops viewport and mutation observers, clears the tooltip marker and
`aria-describedby`, and never leaves disconnected help floating over the next
surface. This is the regression boundary for
[#94](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/issues/94).

## Security considerations

Group colors come from a closed, curated set and are re-validated on every
read and render. An untrusted or corrupted persisted color falls back to the
default rather than reaching an inline style, so a hand-edited profile cannot
inject arbitrary CSS through a group. Group names are rendered as text and are
never interpreted as markup.

## Verification

The group contracts are covered across `tab-groups-test.ts`,
`repository-tab-test.ts`, `profile-tabs-file-test.ts`,
`tab-session-file-test.ts`, and the tab-strip surface checks. Coverage includes
curated-color validation, visible/collapsible chips, profile/window persistence,
safe repair of malformed records, pin-boundary rejection, non-destructive
deletion, atomic manual/sorted ordering, portable-export stripping,
localization, focus, and announcements.

`app/src/ui/repository-tabs/tab-count-copy.ts` owns the one-versus-many
selection used by every tab-group count phrase. In English, exactly one uses
**tab/stays** while zero and two-plus use **tabs/stay** across the group chip,
edit-dialog intro, member-menu button/status, and overflow-button accessible
name. Cantonese keeps its natural count wording through the same selection
contract. The focused suite checks 0, 1, and 2 in both languages plus the real
collapsed-group and overflow-button accessible names, covering
[#95](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/desktop-material/issues/95).

`app/test/unit/ui/tab-group-management-test.tsx` covers the chip cluster's newer
surfaces: a collapsed group listing every member in its dropdown, one-action
member switching, arrow/Home/Enter keyboard navigation with a live
`aria-activedescendant`, deletion from the dropdown leaving every tab open, the
bilingual rendering of the dropdown's copy, and the edit dialog renaming and
recoloring a group — persisted to the profile store — without touching its
membership.

Its **move tab to group chooser** block proves that the native context menu
keeps exactly one enabled move command with zero groups and with 240 groups;
the destination dialog filters 240 rows to one and activates it in one keyboard
action; Space ungroups only a grouped tab; Cantonese roles/names and Escape
focus restoration remain intact; and a disappeared source, deleted destination,
later same-id tab, or changed pin boundary performs no mutation and emits no
false success. Together with the registry and responsive-style files, the
focused chooser gate is **30/30 tests across three files**.

Its `tab group dialog stacking` block pins the layering contract: the new-group
dialog opened from a tab's context menu and the edit dialog opened from the
member dropdown must both land inside `#dialog-layer`, and the strip itself
must contain no `<dialog>` at all. `app/test/unit/floating-surface-style-test.ts`
adds the source-level half of the same contract, including the `.tooltip-host`
rule that makes an unportalled dialog fall into normal flow in the first place.

`app/test/unit/ui/tooltip-viewport-test.tsx` adds the disconnected-owner half:
one regression removes a target before its show delay expires, and another
removes a visible target without `blur` or `mouseout`. Both require the portal,
marker, and accessible description to be absent afterward.
