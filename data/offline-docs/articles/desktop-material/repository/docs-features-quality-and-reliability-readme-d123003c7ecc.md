# Quality and reliability

- [Central diagnostic logging](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.f299fc810ddbc283) — opt-in
  local/remote/both client logging plus an authenticated, redacted, bounded
  ARM64 Docker service for operators and troubleshooting agents.
- [Supply-chain and CI
  hardening](supply-chain-and-ci-hardening.md) — dependency-update proposals,
  frozen lock-file installs, blocking package provenance checks, advisory
  reporting, and concurrency rules that preserve every release-producing run.
- [Renderer startup bundle
  safety](renderer-startup-bundle-safety.md) — keep the Node-side Copilot SDK
  out of browser bundles and fail packaging before an undefined Webpack module
  binding can ship as a blank Windows startup.

This category documents cross-cutting responsiveness, lifecycle, and recovery
contracts that span more than one user workflow.

## Features

- [No-op renderer update
  suppression](no-op-render-update-suppression.md) — prevent an already-closed
  History branch list from emitting a second global app-state update and root
  render whenever users switch between Changes and History.
- [Progressive asynchronous
  loading](progressive-lazy-loading.md) — reveal the usable shell from cached
  and persisted state before optional startup work, evaluate the seven heavy
  inactive repository sections on first activation, and contain each load
  behind screen-reader-announced progress, retry, and newest-request-wins
  lifecycle guards.
- [Root renderer resource
  lifecycle](root-renderer-resource-lifecycle.md) — make store, updater,
  drag-manager, and IPC subscriptions disposable; retain and clear deferred
  polling timers; and release document/window handlers that otherwise keep a
  stale root renderer alive after unmount.
- [Responsiveness and resource
  lifecycle](responsiveness-and-resource-lifecycle.md) — avoid redundant remote
  discovery, hard-bound advisory process cleanup, coalesce stalled proxy work,
  serialize credential prompts, coalesce high-frequency appearance writes, and
  release request and markdown-preview resources deterministically.
- [Peer-closed stream writes](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.76088561427ec57b) — contain the write
  that finishes after its peer already went away (`write EOF`/`EPIPE`) in the
  Cheap LFS upload, trampoline, agent-server, and hooks-proxy transports, plus a
  narrowly-scoped process backstop that turns it into a non-blocking notice
  while every unknown exception stays fatal.
- [Observed user-initiated
  operations](observed-user-initiated-operations.md) — push, force-push, pull,
  and fetch observe the promise they start, so a failed canonical-remote
  preflight is presented once through the normal error machinery instead of
  reaching the global `unhandledrejection` containment as a generic "a
  background action stopped unexpectedly" notice; background refreshes are
  contained as diagnostics instead.
- [Git operation auto-fix](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.fff13802c88d23ee) — a pure classifier that
  recognizes fixable Git failures (stale index.lock, auto-gc/maintenance hang,
  non-fast-forward push, forbidden org-remote push, detached-HEAD commit),
  proposes a safety-classed remediation, and surfaces a localized one-click
  "Fix it" action on the transient error notice without ever force-pushing.
- [Background Git reliability](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.c8b8f18929905b40) — retry only the
  hook-free Windows startup history probe when the bundled launcher itself
  fails and contain repository-indicator failures per repository so one
  offline provider cannot abort the cycle or create an unhandled rejection.
- [Canonical remote preflight
  warning](canonical-remote-preflight-warning.md) — stop a protected network
  mutation before Git runs when the remote destination cannot be proven, then
  show a persistent yellow non-blocking warning with a repository-scoped
  **Change remote URL** action and no credential-bearing URL text.
- [Git hook execution environment](app-doc://article/desktop-material.repository.d84076629c9a8631) — proxy the
  repository's own hooks through the user's configured shell, spool hook
  standard input to a real file so the bundled Windows Git can open it, and
  keep the app-generated Cheap LFS first-publish anchor on `--no-verify` while
  every reviewed push still runs hooks.
- [Native large-repository
  handling](native-large-repository-handling.md) — per-repository large mode
  that extends gc/maintenance suppression to status/add/checkout/fetch plus a
  controlled repack, fail-closed stale-`index.lock` removal, an explicit
  status-computing state, suspended polling with one persistent notification for
  deleted repositories, and confirm-class nested-`.git` compression.

## API applicability

These contracts change local desktop scheduling and cleanup behavior. They add
no HTTP endpoint, so a Postman collection is not applicable.
