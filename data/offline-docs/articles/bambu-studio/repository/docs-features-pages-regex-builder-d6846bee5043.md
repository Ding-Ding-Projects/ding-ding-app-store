# Regex builder

One implementation in `ui-md3/site/regex.js` serves three roles:
the **Regex lab** tab at full width, the disclosure panel under **every** search bar on the site,
and the matcher those search bars actually filter with.

## Engine and dialect

The engine is the visitor's own browser `RegExp` — ECMAScript, not PCRE, not RE2. The site says so
on the builder itself. Consequences worth knowing:

- flags offered are exactly the ones this engine accepts: `g i m s u y`;
- `\p{Script=Han}` only means a Unicode property under the `u` flag — without it
  ECMAScript's Annex B compiles it silently as the literal characters `p{…}` and reports a clean
  "no matches", which is the worst possible answer because nothing looks wrong. Inserting the
  class chip turns `u` on, and a `\p{…}` pattern without it says which flag is missing;
- named groups use `(?<name> … )` and are shown by name in the results. Group identity comes from
  the engine: a group that did not participate keeps its number and renders as `—` rather than
  being dropped, because dropping it renumbers every group after it;
- literal text inserted through the guided control is escaped with `escapeLiteral`, which covers
  `\ ^ $ . | ? * + ( ) [ ] { } /`, so a typed `.` means a full stop.

## Guided construction

Each part inserts at the caret, or wraps the current selection where wrapping is meaningful:

| Part | Offers |
|:---|:---|
| Literal text | an input whose value is escaped on insert |
| Character class | `\d \D \w \s .` `[a-z] [A-Z]` `\p{Script=Han}` |
| Anchor | `^` `$` `\b` `\B` |
| Group | capturing, non-capturing, named, lookahead, negative lookahead |
| Alternation | `\|` and a wrapped `(?: … \| … )` |
| Quantifier | `*` `+` `?` `{n}` `{n,}` `{n,m}` and a lazy `+?` |

Alongside them: a raw pattern editor, flag checkboxes, a sample-text area, a live status line, the
match list with capture groups and offsets, and Copy / Export / Use-this-pattern / Clear.

Export writes a Markdown file naming the engine, the pattern, the flags, the page it came from and
the sample it was tested against — enough for someone else to reproduce the result.

## Search bars

Every search bar on the site is `createSearchField(...)`: an input, a `.*` toggle, and a builder
button. Plain text is always the default; regex applies only after the toggle is pressed. The two
directions stay synchronised — typing in the field updates the builder's pattern, and applying a
pattern from the builder fills the field, switches it to regex mode, **and brings the builder's
flags with it**, so the filtered results cannot contradict the preview the user just approved. An
invalid pattern reports the engine's message under the field and matches everything, so a
half-typed pattern never empties the list the user is reading.

Filtering is id-based rather than predicate-based: the caller supplies `items() -> [{id, text}]`
and receives the ids that matched. That indirection exists so an opt-in regex can be evaluated
inside the worker instead of on the thread that draws the page.

The search bars wired to it: the tab list, settings, the Material You appearance editor, and the
changelog. Each supplies its own surface as the builder's sample text, so the builder is testing
against real content. Every adjustment surface owns one — a single shared search box on the
Settings tab would be a pointer to a control, not a way to find it where it lives.

## Bounds and denial-of-service posture

A user-written pattern can backtrack catastrophically, and a regex engine cannot be interrupted
mid-`exec`. Two bounds apply.

- **Evaluation and search filtering both run in a Web Worker** created from a blob URL and
  **terminated after 400 ms**. A runaway pattern costs a discarded worker, not a frozen page. The
  result says which path ran. A timeout leaves the previous results on screen and explains why they
  did not move — it does not silently show an unfiltered list.
- **Where no worker can be created** (a hardened browser, a `file://` preview), the search bar's
  `.*` toggle is **disabled** and plain text keeps working. Offering an uninterruptible engine on
  the thread that draws the page would be a loaded gun; an honest "not available" is better.
- **The lab's fallback** in that situation is inline matching against a much smaller sample, and it
  **refuses a quantifier nested inside a quantified group** — the `(x+)+` shape — before compiling,
  because a clock cannot interrupt a single `exec()`. Bounding by input is the only bound that
  works there.
- **A worker that fails to start is not a verdict on the pattern.** That case falls back to the
  inline path and says the sandboxed evaluator could not start, quoting what the browser reported,
  rather than reporting a valid pattern as invalid.
- Pattern length is capped at 512 characters, the sample at 20 000 (2 000 inline), matches at 500,
  and a zero-width match advances `lastIndex` so `a*` cannot spin.

Nothing is transmitted. Patterns and sample text are evaluated in the page and never leave it.
