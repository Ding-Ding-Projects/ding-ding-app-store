Wall-Touch Response algorithm

# Touch Signature


  
    Matches safe nudges to the size of steps people actually use on the wall thermostat.
    These algorithms exist for the exact household fight AC Defender is built for: someone keeps raising the thermostat, but the room still needs to come back to your temperature without starting a visible duel.

## The short version

Matches safe nudges to the size of steps people actually use on the wall thermostat.

## What it watches

The recent real wall-thermostat steps (their median size) inside the retention window.

## How it decides

With enough recent steps and a room still inside the signature safety band, it learns the median wall-step size, clamps it between the min and max signature step, and caps safe nudges to that size. Too-warm rooms clear the signature so direct cooling resumes.

## What it changes

Lowers the per-command nudge size used by Natural Walkback.

## Safety boundaries

- Uses the real inputs listed above. It does not invent thermostat, weather, usage, or sensor state.
- Changes only the output listed above. Thermostat-affecting work goes through Home Assistant or returns a real error.
- The global AC Defender rules still apply: the website target remains the floor for cooling commands, the worker keeps refreshing real Home Assistant state 24/7, and comfort/safety rules are not bypassed by decorative timing.

## Where to see it

- **Defense page:** live card with state, verdict, evidence, and metrics.
- **Guide page:** generated from the same guard catalog entry.
- **Source:** `Guards/GuardCatalog.cs` describes this page; the implementation is coordinated by `Services/DefenderStateStore.cs` and `Services/AcDefenderService.cs`.

## Failure modes

If **Touch Signature** cannot obtain one of its required real inputs, it reports a blocked, held, or unavailable result and leaves the background worker's Home Assistant refresh running. It never fills a missing room reading, audit event, weather sample, usage value, or device state with a simulator value. If a real Home Assistant command is rejected, the user sees the service's actual error and the article's surface remains available for recovery.
## Security considerations

This feature consumes only the configured Home Assistant entity data, local settings, and the audit context named above. Tokens and credentials stay in the server environment; the static documentation site does not collect analytics, transmit search text, or embed third-party assets. Logs and exports should be reviewed before sharing because real entity names and timestamps can identify a household.
## Verification

Verify the shipped behavior at the feature's live page or endpoint, then run the repository's documented build and test commands. Confirm the real-input and real-error paths, keyboard access, reduced-motion behavior, and a 390 px viewport without horizontal overflow. Record the exact commit and workflow result when publishing a release; a static screenshot alone is not proof of a live Home Assistant command.
