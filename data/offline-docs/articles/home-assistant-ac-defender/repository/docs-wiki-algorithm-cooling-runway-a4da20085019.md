# Cooling Runway


  
    Gives the AC time to work after cooling starts before nudging the setpoint again.
    These algorithms make corrections land near real house signals instead of on a robotic beat, while still stepping aside when room comfort needs direct cooling.

## The short version

Gives the AC time to work after cooling starts before nudging the setpoint again.

## What it watches

The Home Assistant hvac_action and how long ago cooling started, plus command pressure.

## How it decides

When the action turns to cooling it records the start and holds for the minimum runway seconds plus extra pressure seconds. If cooling stops or the room gets too warm, it clears immediately.

## What it changes

Holds the next safe nudge so a fresh cooling cycle is not interrupted.

## Safety boundaries

- Uses the real inputs listed above. It does not invent thermostat, weather, usage, or sensor state.
- Changes only the output listed above. Thermostat-affecting work goes through Home Assistant or returns a real error.
- The global AC Defender rules still apply: the website target remains the floor for cooling commands, the worker keeps refreshing real Home Assistant state 24/7, and comfort/safety rules are not bypassed by decorative timing.

## Where to see it

- **Defense page:** live card with state, verdict, evidence, and metrics.
- **Guide page:** generated from the same guard catalog entry.
- **Source:** `Guards/GuardCatalog.cs` describes this page; the implementation is coordinated by `Services/DefenderStateStore.cs` and `Services/AcDefenderService.cs`.

## Failure modes

If **Cooling Runway** cannot obtain one of its required real inputs, it reports a blocked, held, or unavailable result and leaves the background worker's Home Assistant refresh running. It never fills a missing room reading, audit event, weather sample, usage value, or device state with a simulator value. If a real Home Assistant command is rejected, the user sees the service's actual error and the article's surface remains available for recovery.
## Security considerations

This feature consumes only the configured Home Assistant entity data, local settings, and the audit context named above. Tokens and credentials stay in the server environment; the static documentation site does not collect analytics, transmit search text, or embed third-party assets. Logs and exports should be reviewed before sharing because real entity names and timestamps can identify a household.
## Verification

Verify the shipped behavior at the feature's live page or endpoint, then run the repository's documented build and test commands. Confirm the real-input and real-error paths, keyboard access, reduced-motion behavior, and a 390 px viewport without horizontal overflow. Record the exact commit and workflow result when publishing a release; a static screenshot alone is not proof of a live Home Assistant command.
